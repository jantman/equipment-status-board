# Tech-Spec: Duplicate Repair Association

**Created:** 2026-05-13

**GitHub Issue:** [#43 Duplicate Repair Association](https://github.com/jantman/equipment-status-board/issues/43)

## Overview

### Problem Statement

When a repair record is closed with status `Closed - Duplicate` (via Web UI or Slack), the system only records the status string. There is no captured reference to which other repair record on the same equipment is being duplicated. This makes it impossible to query correlations (e.g. "show me all the repairs that were duplicates of repair #123") and forces staff to scan repair descriptions or timelines to figure out which prior report a duplicate refers to.

### Solution

Add a nullable `duplicated_repair_id` foreign key on `repair_records` pointing back to `repair_records.id`. Whenever a user transitions a repair to `Closed - Duplicate` — in the Web UI edit form or the Slack action modal — they are required to pick which repair on the **same equipment** the current repair duplicates. Selection uses a dropdown / `static_select` populated with the equipment's other repair records, sorted newest-first, each option labeled `#{id} [{status}] {description excerpt}`. The service layer enforces the invariant that **a status transition to `Closed - Duplicate` requires `duplicated_repair_id` to be set**, and the chosen target must belong to the same equipment and not be the record itself. The repair detail view renders the link; audit-log entries record the `duplicated_repair_id` change.

### Scope

**In Scope:**

- New nullable `duplicated_repair_id` column on `repair_records` (FK → `repair_records.id`, `ON DELETE SET NULL`, indexed).
- Alembic migration adding the column + FK + index, via `op.batch_alter_table` (MariaDB-compatible pattern used throughout this repo).
- `RepairRecord` model: add the column and a self-referential `duplicated_repair` relationship (`remote_side=[id]`).
- `repair_service.update_repair_record()`:
  - Add `'duplicated_repair_id'` to `_REPAIR_UPDATABLE_FIELDS` so it flows through the existing change-detection / timeline / audit pipeline.
  - Add validation (see **Technical Decisions §3** for the precise rule).
  - Emit a timeline entry for the change (entry_type `duplicated_repair_id_change`, old/new IDs as strings).
- `repair_service.list_duplicate_candidates(repair_record_id)` — new helper returning the equipment's other repair records (excluding the record itself), ordered `created_at DESC`.
- Web UI:
  - `RepairRecordUpdateForm` adds `duplicated_repair_id = SelectField(..., coerce=int, validators=[Optional()])`. `0` is the sentinel for "none".
  - `views/repairs.py::edit()` populates `form.duplicated_repair_id.choices` from `list_duplicate_candidates(id)` on both GET and POST, passes the chosen value (or `None` if `0`) into `update_repair_record()`.
  - `templates/repairs/edit.html`: render the new dropdown in a wrapper `<div id="duplicate-block">` that is shown iff `form.status.data == 'Closed - Duplicate'` on initial render. Add a small inline `<script>` toggling visibility when the status `<select>` changes.
  - `templates/repairs/detail.html`: render a "Marked as duplicate of #N" row in the Repair Information `<dl>` when `record.duplicated_repair_id` is set, with a link to that repair's detail page.
- Slack:
  - `build_repair_action_modal(repair_record)` adds an optional `static_select` block (`block_id='duplicate_block'`, `action_id='duplicated_repair_id'`) populated by querying `repair_service.list_duplicate_candidates(repair_record.id)`. Block label: `"Duplicate of (used when 'Set Status → Closed - Duplicate' chosen)"`. Each option text: `f'#{r.id} [{r.status}] {r.description[:60]}'` truncated to 75 chars.
  - **If the equipment has zero other repairs, remove `Closed - Duplicate` from the status dropdown options entirely** and omit the duplicate block. The user cannot mark a one-and-only repair as a duplicate.
  - `handle_repair_action_submission()`: when `action == 'set_status'` and `status_opt['value'] == 'Closed - Duplicate'`, read `duplicated_repair_id` from the same view state and pass both into `update_repair_record()`. If missing → return Slack inline error on `duplicate_block`. ValidationError from the service is surfaced on `status_block`.
- `build_repair_create_modal`: filter `Closed - Duplicate` out of the status dropdown options (a repair cannot be created already-duplicate; the create flow does not have access to a target repair).
- Audit logging: the existing `update_repair_record` audit-changes mechanism already produces an entry like `'duplicated_repair_id': [old_str, new_str]` — no extra code beyond adding the field to `_REPAIR_UPDATABLE_FIELDS`.
- Tests covering: model column + relationship, service validation (positive + each negative case), web view form rendering + submission, Slack action modal flow including zero-candidates edge case, and Slack create modal filter.

**Authorization (unchanged):**

- No new authorization surfaces. The web edit route is already gated by `@role_required('technician')` (`esb/views/repairs.py:289`) and the Slack action modal flow already gates on `esb_user.role in ('technician', 'staff')` (`esb/slack/handlers.py:538-542`). Both gates apply unchanged to the new field — members cannot reach the duplicate-of dropdown via any path.

**Out of Scope:**

- Backfilling existing rows that already have `Closed - Duplicate` status — they keep `duplicated_repair_id = NULL`. Editing such legacy rows for non-status fields must remain possible (see Technical Decisions §3.c).
- A reverse-direction view ("repairs that were duplicates of *this* repair") — possible later via SQLAlchemy `backref`, but not built in this story.
- Auto-suggesting likely duplicates based on description similarity.
- Cross-equipment duplicates.
- Changing the duplicate target by editing the repair *after* the close — technically allowed by the service rules (since `duplicated_repair_id` is just a field), but no UI affordance is provided. Out of scope as a feature; the field is editable via direct DB or future admin tooling.
- A `CHECK` constraint coupling `status` and `duplicated_repair_id` at the DB layer. Enforced in service layer only (consistency with existing patterns).
- Cycle detection in duplicate chains.

## Context for Development

### Codebase Patterns

- **Service-layer business logic:** All validation and writes go through `esb/services/repair_service.py`. Views and Slack handlers never query or commit directly. Invariants raise `ValidationError` (from `esb.utils.exceptions`) — the exception type used throughout `repair_service.py` (see `update_repair_record` status validation at line 500-501). **Not** bare `ValueError`.
- **`update_repair_record` kwargs pattern:** signature is `(repair_record_id, updated_by, author_id=None, **changes)`. It validates inbound values, pops `note` (it's not a model field), then enforces an allowlist via `_REPAIR_UPDATABLE_FIELDS = ('status', 'severity', 'assignee_id', 'eta', 'specialist_description')` (line 22): any unknown keys raise `ValidationError(f'Unknown fields: ...')` (line 513-515). Adding a new updatable field requires extending this tuple. Change-detection compares `getattr(record, field) != changes[field]` and emits a per-field timeline entry inside the same transaction.
- **`create_repair_record` does NOT accept a `status` argument** (hardcodes `status='New'` at line 110). The Slack create-modal handler emulates "create with status" by calling `create_repair_record` then `update_repair_record(status=...)` (`handlers.py:244-253` with the comment "Setting non-"New" status requires a second service call"). So defense for the duplicated_repair_id invariant lives entirely in `update_repair_record`.
- **Audit logging:** `log_mutation('repair_record.updated', updated_by, {'id': ..., 'changes': audit_changes})` is called after `db.session.commit()`. `audit_changes` is a dict of `{field: [old_serialized, new_serialized]}`. Adding `'duplicated_repair_id'` to `_REPAIR_UPDATABLE_FIELDS` automatically routes it through this flow; no extra `log_mutation` calls are needed.
- **Timeline entry creation in `update_repair_record`:** the loop at line 519-560 handles `status`, `assignee_id`, and `eta` specially (with custom entry_types). For other allowlisted fields it currently emits NO timeline entry (specialist_description doesn't either). We need to add a `duplicated_repair_id_change` entry type so the change is visible in the timeline — see Tasks.
- **Form pattern:** Flask-WTF forms in `esb/forms/repair_forms.py`; `SelectField` with `coerce=int` uses `0` as the "unselected" sentinel (see `assignee_id`-from-`RepairRecordUpdateForm`, paired with `assignee_id if form.assignee_id.data != 0 else None` in views/repairs.py:324).
- **Slack modal pattern:** `esb/slack/forms.py` defines `build_*_modal()` Block Kit dict builders; `esb/slack/handlers.py` `handle_*_submission()` parses `view['state']['values']`. The action modal already follows the pattern of "show all possibly-needed inputs, server resolves which apply based on the radio choice" (see ETA / status / note blocks). The new duplicate block extends this pattern; no new modal-push is needed.
- **Slack app-context wrapper:** All handlers wrap their body with `with _ensure_app_context(app):` (defined at `handlers.py:11-27`). The new validation flow runs through `update_repair_record`, which is already wrapped by the caller.
- **Migrations:** `migrations/versions/{revisionid}_{slug}.py` using `op.batch_alter_table`. The `revisionid` is generated by Alembic via the `flask db migrate` workflow documented in CLAUDE.md — must be generated against the live MariaDB container (port 3306 not host-mapped).
- **Testing:** SQLite in-memory in `TestingConfig`; CSRF disabled. Fixtures: `make_equipment`, `make_repair_record`, `staff_client`, `tech_client`, `capture` (mutation log capture). Test class pattern: one class per behavior, e.g. `TestCreateRepairRecord`, `TestRepairActionSubmission`. View tests post form data with `follow_redirects=False` and assert `302` Location header. Service tests assert DB state via `_db.session.get(...)` after `expire_all()`.

### Technical Decisions

1. **`duplicated_repair_id` is nullable, with `ON DELETE SET NULL`.** A repair may not be a duplicate (the common case), and we don't want deletion of the target repair to cascade-delete the duplicate. `SET NULL` semantics preserve the historical "this was marked as a duplicate" status even if the original target is later deleted; staff can investigate via audit log.

2. **No status-enum change.** `Closed - Duplicate` is already in `REPAIR_STATUSES` (model line 17). We're adding a paired-field constraint, not a new status value.

3. **Validation lives in the service layer, conditionally.** Three rules in `update_repair_record`. **All rules key on real *transitions*, not idempotent re-submissions** — the web form always POSTs the current `status` value, so `'status' in changes` is true even when the value matches the record. To avoid breaking the legacy carve-out, the rules check `changes['status'] != record.status` before treating something as a transition.

   **a. Status transition *to* `Closed - Duplicate` requires a target.**
   If `'status' in changes and changes['status'] == 'Closed - Duplicate' and record.status != 'Closed - Duplicate'`:
   - `effective_dup_id = changes.get('duplicated_repair_id', record.duplicated_repair_id)`
   - `effective_dup_id` must not be `None` → else `ValidationError("'Closed - Duplicate' requires a duplicated_repair_id")`.
   - `effective_dup_id != repair_record_id` → else `ValidationError("A repair cannot be a duplicate of itself")`.
   - target = `db.session.get(RepairRecord, effective_dup_id)` must exist → else `ValidationError(f"Duplicated repair {effective_dup_id} not found")`.
   - `target.equipment_id == record.equipment_id` → else `ValidationError("Duplicated repair must be on the same equipment")`.

   **b. Explicitly setting `duplicated_repair_id` to non-None requires status is/becomes `Closed - Duplicate`.**
   If `'duplicated_repair_id' in changes and changes['duplicated_repair_id'] is not None`:
   - `effective_status = changes.get('status', record.status)` must equal `'Closed - Duplicate'` → else `ValidationError("duplicated_repair_id cannot be set unless status is 'Closed - Duplicate' (defense-in-depth: web UI hides the field and Slack omits it from non-Closed-Duplicate flows)")`.
   - Plus same-equipment / non-self / target-exists checks as in (a).

   **c. Status transition *away* from `Closed - Duplicate` auto-clears `duplicated_repair_id`.**
   If `'status' in changes and changes['status'] != 'Closed - Duplicate' and record.status == 'Closed - Duplicate'` and `record.duplicated_repair_id is not None` and `'duplicated_repair_id' not in changes`: implicitly inject `changes['duplicated_repair_id'] = None`. This is the only "silent" mutation — it audit-logs as `{'duplicated_repair_id': [old, None]}` via the normal flow. **UX requirement:** callers (web view, Slack handler) must detect that this auto-clear happened (by comparing pre-update `record.duplicated_repair_id` vs post-update value) and surface a user-visible notice so the disappearing link is not silent at the UI layer.

   **Legacy-record carve-out:** Because rule (a) requires `record.status != 'Closed - Duplicate'` (a real transition), a legacy row with `status='Closed - Duplicate'` and `duplicated_repair_id=NULL` can be edited for unrelated fields (note, specialist_description) without tripping validation — the form re-asserting the existing status is a no-op transition. Rule (b) also tolerates legacy state: it only fires when a non-None `duplicated_repair_id` is explicitly set, and a legacy record's NULL value passed through the form stays NULL (treated as no-op since `record.duplicated_repair_id is None == changes['duplicated_repair_id'] is None`).

4. **The duplicate target's status is unrestricted.** A repair can be marked as a duplicate of any other repair on the same equipment, including another `Closed - Duplicate` one or an already-resolved one. Avoids forcing users to find the "root" duplicate; staff can follow the chain if needed. **No cycle detection** — chains are operationally harmless and detection adds complexity.

5. **Slack: single-modal approach, no nested modal push.** The action modal already follows the pattern of "show all possibly-needed inputs (ETA, status, note), server resolves which apply based on the radio choice." Adding the duplicate `static_select` as another always-visible-but-optional block extends this pattern. The alternative — pushing a third modal after the user picks `Closed - Duplicate` — would require Slack's `ack(response_action='push', view=...)` from within an already-pushed modal (3-level deep stack). Single-modal is simpler, has fewer race conditions, and matches the existing UX.

6. **Slack: zero-candidates edge case.** When `list_duplicate_candidates(record.id)` returns an empty list (the equipment has only this one repair, ever), `build_repair_action_modal` **removes `'Closed - Duplicate'` from the status dropdown options** and **omits the duplicate block entirely**. The user cannot pick an unsatisfiable status. (This is preferred over showing the option and letting the server reject — better UX, less confusing.)

7. **Web UI: conditional JS show/hide on status select.** Inline `<script>` watches the status `<select>` `change` event; toggles `style.display` on the duplicate-block wrapper. Default visibility on GET matches `record.status == 'Closed - Duplicate'`. The duplicate dropdown is always rendered server-side with full candidate list (no AJAX), regardless of the current status — display is a CSS concern only. **No-JS fallback:** without JS the block is always visible (`display:block` default) — degraded but functional; users can still submit. This matches the simplicity of the existing form; the repo has no client-side framework.

8. **Status-aware description budget in dropdown labels.** Slack `static_select` option `text.text` has a 75-char limit. Naive `desc[:60]` plus a worst-case prefix overflows: `#999999 [Closed - No Issue Found] ` is 35 chars; that leaves only 40 chars for the description before hitting 75, and naive `[:75]` truncation would slice mid-string with no ellipsis. The spec uses a *status-aware* budget computed at option-build time:
    ```python
    def _build_label(r):
        prefix = f'#{r.id} [{r.status}] '
        budget = 75 - len(prefix)
        if len(r.description) <= budget:
            return prefix + r.description
        return prefix + r.description[: max(0, budget - 1)].rstrip() + '…'
    ```
    This guarantees the label fits in 75 chars and emits an ellipsis when truncated. The Slack implementation should also call the existing `_truncate` helper (`esb/slack/forms.py:13-17`) for consistency where applicable. Web `<select>` option text uses the same logic for visual consistency.

9. **Self-referential FK with `remote_side`:** the model relationship uses `db.relationship('RepairRecord', remote_side=[id])` to disambiguate "the one I duplicate" from the implicit reverse "the ones that duplicate me." We do not add a `backref` for the reverse direction (deferred — out of scope per issue scope).

10. **`Closed - Duplicate` removed from `build_repair_create_modal` status options.** A repair cannot meaningfully be *created* already-duplicate via Slack: the create flow has no UI for the dup-target dropdown, and the follow-up `update_repair_record` would fail validation. Filter at the option-list construction site rather than surfacing a confusing error.

11. **Web UI create form is not affected.** `RepairRecordCreateForm` doesn't expose `status` (status is hardcoded to `'New'` by `create_repair_record`), so no filter is needed on the web create path.

12. **Timeline entry for duplicated_repair_id changes.** Add a new `entry_type='duplicated_repair_id_change'` with `old_value`/`new_value` as stringified IDs (or `None` for absent). **Both the model-level constant `TIMELINE_ENTRY_TYPES` (`esb/models/repair_timeline_entry.py`) and the template `components/_timeline_entry.html` must be updated together** — the constant is authoritative, and the template currently renders only the six existing types (unknown types render as blank list items). Tasks 5 step 4 and Task 11 cover these respectively.

## Implementation Plan

### Tasks

Tasks are ordered by dependency: schema → service → web → Slack → verification. Each phase's tests live alongside the source change so the test suite stays green between phases.

#### Phase 1: Data Layer

- [ ] **Task 1: Add `duplicated_repair_id` column + self-relationship to `RepairRecord` model.**
  - File: `esb/models/repair_record.py`
  - Action: After `specialist_description` (line 41) add `duplicated_repair_id = db.Column(db.Integer, db.ForeignKey('repair_records.id', ondelete='SET NULL'), nullable=True, index=True)`. After the existing `assignee` relationship (line 56) add `duplicated_repair = db.relationship('RepairRecord', remote_side=[id])`.
  - Notes: No `backref` (out of scope). `remote_side=[id]` is the SQLAlchemy idiom for self-referential many-to-one.

- [ ] **Task 2: Create Alembic migration for the new column.**
  - File: `migrations/versions/{auto}_add_duplicated_repair_id.py` (new file)
  - Action: Per CLAUDE.md migration workflow: `docker compose up -d db`, `docker inspect equipment-status-board-db-1 --format '{{range .NetworkSettings.Networks}}{{.IPAddress}}{{end}}'`, then `DATABASE_URL="mysql+pymysql://root:esb_dev_password@<IP>/esb" venv/bin/flask db migrate -m "Add duplicated_repair_id to repair_records"`. Inspect the generated file and ensure: `op.batch_alter_table('repair_records')` adds the column, the FK constraint includes `ondelete='SET NULL'`, and the index `ix_repair_records_duplicated_repair_id` is created. Add the index manually if Alembic missed it. Verify `downgrade()` drops index → constraint → column in reverse order. Apply with `flask db upgrade`.
  - Notes: Alembic sometimes drops `ondelete='SET NULL'` from autogen — verify and patch.

- [ ] **Task 3: Model-layer tests + SQLite FK pragma enablement.**
  - Files: `tests/test_models/test_repair_record.py`, `esb/extensions.py` (or wherever the SQLAlchemy engine is configured for tests).
  - Action:
    1. **Enable SQLite FK enforcement in the test config.** SQLite does NOT enforce `ON DELETE SET NULL` by default. Add a SQLAlchemy `engine_connect` (or `connect`) event listener — gated to SQLite dialects only — that issues `PRAGMA foreign_keys=ON` per connection. Standard pattern:
       ```python
       from sqlalchemy import event
       from sqlalchemy.engine import Engine

       @event.listens_for(Engine, 'connect')
       def _sqlite_fk_pragma(dbapi_conn, _):
           # Only the SQLite driver exposes a cursor that accepts PRAGMA.
           # MariaDB connections will fail this isinstance check and skip.
           import sqlite3
           if isinstance(dbapi_conn, sqlite3.Connection):
               cursor = dbapi_conn.cursor()
               cursor.execute('PRAGMA foreign_keys=ON')
               cursor.close()
       ```
       Place this in a module that loads at app/test startup (e.g., near the bottom of `esb/extensions.py` after `db = SQLAlchemy()`). If a similar listener already exists, just confirm it's active in the test config.
    2. Add tests asserting (a) the new column is nullable on a fresh record, (b) setting `duplicated_repair_id` and accessing `.duplicated_repair` loads the target, (c) deleting the target via `db.session.delete(target); commit()` nulls the child's FK on refresh.
  - Notes: If enabling the pragma globally is undesirable (it changes behavior for the whole test suite, which could surface latent FK violations in unrelated tests), the fallback is to mark AC-2's automated test `@pytest.mark.skipif` for SQLite and verify ON DELETE SET NULL only in a manual integration smoke against MariaDB. Prefer enabling the pragma — surfacing latent FK violations is a feature, not a regression.

#### Phase 2: Service Layer

- [ ] **Task 4: Add `list_duplicate_candidates` helper.**
  - File: `esb/services/repair_service.py`
  - Action: After `list_repair_records` (line 217), add:
    ```python
    def list_duplicate_candidates(repair_record_id: int) -> list[RepairRecord]:
        """Return same-equipment repair records (excluding self), newest first."""
        record = get_repair_record(repair_record_id)
        query = (
            db.select(RepairRecord)
            .filter(RepairRecord.equipment_id == record.equipment_id)
            .filter(RepairRecord.id != record.id)
            .order_by(RepairRecord.created_at.desc())
        )
        return list(db.session.execute(query).scalars().all())
    ```
  - Notes: `get_repair_record` raises `ValidationError` if the id is missing — propagates naturally.

- [ ] **Task 5: Extend `_REPAIR_UPDATABLE_FIELDS` and add validation + timeline entry to `update_repair_record`.**
  - File: `esb/services/repair_service.py`
  - Action:
    1. Line 22: append `'duplicated_repair_id'` to `_REPAIR_UPDATABLE_FIELDS`.
    2. In `update_repair_record` (line 470+), after the existing input validations (after line 507, before `note = changes.pop(...)`), insert the validation block per Technical Decisions §3. **Note the transition guards — all rules require `record.status` to differ from `changes['status']` so the web form re-asserting an unchanged status is a no-op (preserves the legacy carve-out):**
       ```python
       effective_status = changes.get('status', record.status)
       effective_dup_id = changes.get('duplicated_repair_id', record.duplicated_repair_id)

       transitioning_to_closed_dup = (
           'status' in changes
           and changes['status'] == 'Closed - Duplicate'
           and record.status != 'Closed - Duplicate'
       )
       setting_dup_explicit = (
           'duplicated_repair_id' in changes
           and changes['duplicated_repair_id'] is not None
           and changes['duplicated_repair_id'] != record.duplicated_repair_id
       )
       transitioning_away_from_closed_dup = (
           'status' in changes
           and changes['status'] != 'Closed - Duplicate'
           and record.status == 'Closed - Duplicate'
       )

       if transitioning_to_closed_dup:
           if effective_dup_id is None:
               raise ValidationError(
                   "'Closed - Duplicate' status requires a duplicated_repair_id",
               )
       if setting_dup_explicit:
           if effective_status != 'Closed - Duplicate':
               raise ValidationError(
                   "duplicated_repair_id cannot be set unless status is 'Closed - Duplicate'",
               )
       if transitioning_to_closed_dup or setting_dup_explicit:
           target_id = effective_dup_id
           if target_id == repair_record_id:
               raise ValidationError('A repair cannot be a duplicate of itself')
           target = db.session.get(RepairRecord, target_id)
           if target is None:
               raise ValidationError(f'Duplicated repair {target_id} not found')
           if target.equipment_id != record.equipment_id:
               raise ValidationError(
                   'Duplicated repair must be on the same equipment',
               )

       # Silent clear when status transitions away from Closed - Duplicate.
       # Callers must surface a user-visible notice -- see Tasks 8 and 15.
       if (
           transitioning_away_from_closed_dup
           and record.duplicated_repair_id is not None
           and 'duplicated_repair_id' not in changes
       ):
           changes['duplicated_repair_id'] = None
       ```
    3. In the per-field timeline-entry loop (line 519+), add an `elif field_name == 'duplicated_repair_id':` branch emitting `RepairTimelineEntry(repair_record_id=record.id, entry_type='duplicated_repair_id_change', author_id=author_id, author_name=updated_by, old_value=str(old_value) if old_value is not None else None, new_value=str(new_value) if new_value is not None else None)`.
    4. In `esb/models/repair_timeline_entry.py`, append `'duplicated_repair_id_change'` to `TIMELINE_ENTRY_TYPES` (line 7-14). This constant is the authoritative list of legal entry_type values; adding the new type without updating it leaves the constant stale and breaks any future code that validates against it.
  - Notes: `audit_changes['duplicated_repair_id']` and `log_mutation` flow through automatically because the field is now in `_REPAIR_UPDATABLE_FIELDS`. Place validation BEFORE the unknown-keys check at line 513.

- [ ] **Task 6: Service-layer tests.**
  - File: `tests/test_services/test_repair_service.py`
  - Action: Add two new test classes:
    1. `TestListDuplicateCandidates` — covers ordering newest-first, self-exclusion, equipment filtering, missing-record `ValidationError`, empty result for single-repair equipment.
    2. `TestDuplicatedRepairId` — covers the eight ACs in the Service Layer section below (AC-4 through AC-11).
  - Notes: Use `make_equipment` and `make_repair_record` factories; assert via `_db.session.get(RepairRecord, id)` after `_db.session.expire_all()`.

#### Phase 3: Web UI

- [ ] **Task 7: Add `duplicated_repair_id` field to `RepairRecordUpdateForm`.**
  - File: `esb/forms/repair_forms.py`
  - Action: After `specialist_description` (line 43) on `RepairRecordUpdateForm` add:
    ```python
    duplicated_repair_id = SelectField(
        'Duplicate of', coerce=int, validators=[Optional()],
    )
    ```
  - Notes: `0` is the unselected sentinel (consistent with `assignee_id`).

- [ ] **Task 8: Populate dropdown choices, pass through in `repairs.edit` view, and surface silent-clear UX.**
  - File: `esb/views/repairs.py`
  - Action: In `edit()` (line 288+):
    1. After the assignee choices (around line 306), add (use `_truncate` from `esb/slack/forms.py` or inline equivalent to budget the label safely; see Technical Decisions §8):
       ```python
       candidates = repair_service.list_duplicate_candidates(id)
       def _candidate_label(c):
           prefix = f'#{c.id} [{c.status}] '
           budget = 75 - len(prefix)
           desc = c.description if len(c.description) <= budget else c.description[: max(0, budget - 1)].rstrip() + '…'
           return prefix + desc
       form.duplicated_repair_id.choices = [(0, '-- Select duplicate of --')] + [
           (c.id, _candidate_label(c)) for c in candidates
       ]
       ```
    2. On GET (~line 308-314) add `form.duplicated_repair_id.data = record.duplicated_repair_id or 0`.
    3. In the validated POST branch (line 316+):
       a. **Before** calling `update_repair_record`, capture `had_dup_link = (record.status == 'Closed - Duplicate' and record.duplicated_repair_id is not None)` and `target_status = form.status.data`.
       b. Pass into the service call: `duplicated_repair_id=(form.duplicated_repair_id.data if form.duplicated_repair_id.data != 0 else None)`.
       c. **After** the call returns successfully (before the existing success-flash + redirect), surface the silent-clear when it happened: if `had_dup_link and target_status != 'Closed - Duplicate'`, flash an `info` message: `'Duplicate link cleared because status changed away from "Closed - Duplicate".'`
  - Notes:
    - Service `ValidationError` surfaces via the existing `flash(str(e), 'danger')` + re-render flow (lines 329-331). It does **NOT** populate `form.duplicated_repair_id.errors`; the inline form-error rendering in the template is a no-op for this field (no WTForms-layer validators are defined that would produce errors), and is kept only for consistency with sibling fields.
    - The silent-clear flash MUST fire before the "Repair record updated successfully." flash so users see both messages in order.

- [ ] **Task 9: Conditional duplicate-block in `repairs/edit.html`.**
  - File: `esb/templates/repairs/edit.html`
  - Action: After the status block (after line 26), insert (note: no inline `form.duplicated_repair_id.errors` block — WTForms-layer validation does not apply to this field; the only errors come from the service layer and are surfaced via flash messages, not field errors):
    ```html
    <div id="duplicate-block" class="mb-3"{% if form.status.data != 'Closed - Duplicate' %} style="display: none;"{% endif %}>
        <label for="duplicated_repair_id" class="form-label">Duplicate of *</label>
        {{ form.duplicated_repair_id(class="form-select") }}
        <div class="form-text">Required when status is "Closed - Duplicate".</div>
    </div>
    ```
    Inside `{% block content %}`, after the closing `</form>` and before `{% endblock %}`, append:
    ```html
    <script>
    (function () {
        const statusSelect = document.querySelector('select[name="status"]');
        const dupBlock = document.getElementById('duplicate-block');
        if (!statusSelect || !dupBlock) return;
        const sync = () => { dupBlock.style.display = statusSelect.value === 'Closed - Duplicate' ? '' : 'none'; };
        statusSelect.addEventListener('change', sync);
    })();
    </script>
    ```
  - Notes:
    - No-JS fallback is `display:block` (visible). Inline script is consistent with the repo's no-framework template style.
    - Service `ValidationError` surfaces through `flash(str(e), 'danger')` (existing pattern at `views/repairs.py:329-331`), rendered by the layout's flash component on the re-rendered edit page. Do NOT route service errors through `form.duplicated_repair_id.errors` — keep the layers separated as in sibling fields.

- [ ] **Task 10: Render "Marked as duplicate of" link on the detail page.**
  - File: `esb/templates/repairs/detail.html`
  - Action: In the Repair Information `<dl>` (lines 50-80), between the Status and Severity rows, add:
    ```html
    {% if record.duplicated_repair_id %}
    <dt class="col-sm-3">Marked as duplicate of</dt>
    <dd class="col-sm-9"><a href="{{ url_for('repairs.detail', id=record.duplicated_repair_id) }}">Repair #{{ record.duplicated_repair_id }}</a></dd>
    {% endif %}
    ```

- [ ] **Task 11: Add `duplicated_repair_id_change` rendering to the timeline component.**
  - File: `esb/templates/components/_timeline_entry.html`
  - Action: Add a new `{% elif entry.entry_type == 'duplicated_repair_id_change' %}` branch after the `eta_update` branch:
    ```html
    {% elif entry.entry_type == 'duplicated_repair_id_change' %}
    <span class="badge bg-secondary me-1">Duplicate</span>
    <strong>
        {% if entry.new_value %}
        Marked as duplicate of <a href="{{ url_for('repairs.detail', id=entry.new_value|int) }}">#{{ entry.new_value }}</a>
        {% else %}
        Unlinked from duplicate{% if entry.old_value %} #{{ entry.old_value }}{% endif %}
        {% endif %}
    </strong>
    ```

- [ ] **Task 12: Web view tests.**
  - File: `tests/test_views/test_repair_views.py`
  - Action: Extend `TestRepairEdit` (line 183+) with tests covering AC-14 through AC-18, including the silent-clear info flash assertion (AC-18 explicit requirement: response body of the redirected detail page contains the string `'Duplicate link cleared'`). Use `follow_redirects=True` for AC-18's flash assertion so the redirected page is rendered.

#### Phase 4: Slack

- [ ] **Task 13: Filter `Closed - Duplicate` out of `build_repair_create_modal` status options.**
  - File: `esb/slack/forms.py`
  - Action: In `build_repair_create_modal` (line 318+, status block at ~line 396-413), change the options comprehension to `[ ... for s in REPAIR_STATUSES if s != 'Closed - Duplicate']`.

- [ ] **Task 14: Add duplicate-of block to `build_repair_action_modal`; handle zero-candidates; replace hardcoded status options.**
  - File: `esb/slack/forms.py`
  - Action: In `build_repair_action_modal(repair_record)` (line 626+):
    1. **First**, near the top of the function body, fetch candidates via a function-local (lazy) import to avoid any future circular-import risk between `slack/forms.py` and `services/repair_service.py`:
       ```python
       from esb.services import repair_service  # local: avoid module-level cycle
       candidates = repair_service.list_duplicate_candidates(repair_record.id)
       ```
    2. **Compute `status_options` dynamically.** Start from `[('In Progress', 'In Progress'), ('Closed - Duplicate', 'Closed - Duplicate'), ('Closed - No Issue Found', 'Closed - No Issue Found')]`. If `not candidates`, drop the `Closed - Duplicate` tuple.
    3. **DELETE the hardcoded options list currently at lines 698-702** (the `'options': [{'text': ..., 'text': 'In Progress'} ... ]` literal in the status block) and replace it with options built from `status_options`:
       ```python
       'options': [
           {'text': {'type': 'plain_text', 'text': label}, 'value': value}
           for value, label in status_options
       ],
       ```
       **This deletion is the most error-prone step** — a developer who appends new logic without removing the literal will leave `Closed - Duplicate` always present and silently break AC-20.
    4. After the note block, if `candidates`, append the duplicate block. Use the status-aware label helper (Technical Decisions §8):
       ```python
       def _label(r):
           prefix = f'#{r.id} [{r.status}] '
           budget = 75 - len(prefix)
           if len(r.description) <= budget:
               return prefix + r.description
           return prefix + r.description[: max(0, budget - 1)].rstrip() + '…'

       dup_options = [
           {
               'text': {'type': 'plain_text', 'text': _label(r)},
               'value': str(r.id),
           }
           for r in candidates
       ]
       blocks.append({
           'type': 'input',
           'block_id': 'duplicate_block',
           'optional': True,
           'element': {
               'type': 'static_select',
               'action_id': 'duplicated_repair_id',
               'placeholder': {'type': 'plain_text', 'text': 'Select duplicated repair'},
               'options': dup_options,
           },
           'label': {'type': 'plain_text', 'text': "Duplicate of (used when 'Set Status → Closed - Duplicate' chosen)"},
       })
       ```
       (Alternatively, lift `_label` to module scope or import `_truncate` from this file and use it for the description portion.)
  - Notes: `optional: True` so the modal can be submitted with action != set_status. Server-side validation enforces presence when needed. The lazy import in step 1 follows the same pattern used in `repair_service.py:38` (`from esb.services import notification_service`).

- [ ] **Task 15: Handle duplicate selection (and silent-clear UX) in `handle_repair_action_submission`.**
  - File: `esb/slack/handlers.py`
  - Action:
    1. In the `elif action == 'set_status':` branch (~line 598-605), after `changes['status'] = status_opt['value']`, add:
       ```python
       if changes['status'] == 'Closed - Duplicate':
           dup_opt = (
               values.get('duplicate_block', {})
               .get('duplicated_repair_id', {})
               .get('selected_option')
           )
           if not dup_opt:
               ack(response_action='errors', errors={
                   'duplicate_block': 'Selecting which repair this duplicates is required.',
               })
               return
           try:
               changes['duplicated_repair_id'] = int(dup_opt['value'])
           except (KeyError, TypeError, ValueError):
               ack(response_action='errors', errors={
                   'duplicate_block': 'Invalid duplicate selection.',
               })
               return
       ```
    2. Capture pre-update state for the silent-clear UX surface (place this earlier, alongside the existing record fetch on line ~554):
       ```python
       had_dup_link = (record.status == 'Closed - Duplicate' and record.duplicated_repair_id is not None)
       ```
    3. In the post-success ephemeral message section (~line 658-671), when the action is `set_status` and `had_dup_link and changes.get('status') != 'Closed - Duplicate'`, append a second line to the ephemeral text or post a second ephemeral message: `':information_source: Duplicate link cleared because status changed away from "Closed - Duplicate".'`
  - Notes: Service-layer ValidationError (e.g., cross-equipment from a stale modal — see AC-25 race-condition case) still surfaces on `action_block` via the existing exception handler.

- [ ] **Task 16: Slack tests.**
  - Files: `tests/test_slack/test_handlers.py`, `tests/test_slack/test_forms.py`
  - Action:
    - `test_forms.py`: tests for AC-19 (action modal with candidates includes duplicate_block), AC-20 (zero candidates omits block + filters status option), AC-21 (create modal filters status option), plus a test for the status-aware label budget (Technical Decisions §8) — assert no option's `text.text` exceeds 75 chars when the candidate's description is artificially long.
    - `test_handlers.py`: extend `TestRepairActionSubmission` with AC-22 (successful Closed-Dup submission, including silent-clear ephemeral assertion when applicable), AC-23 (missing duplicate selection returns inline error), and AC-24 (stale-modal race: target deleted between modal-build and submit — assert service ValidationError surfaces via `ack(response_action='errors', errors={'action_block': ...})` and that `update_repair_record`'s effect is rolled back / R1 unchanged).

#### Phase 5: Verify

- [ ] **Task 17: Run lint and full test suite.**
  - Action: `make lint && make test`. Address any ruff complaints (120-char lines, target Python 3.13). All existing tests must still pass.

### Acceptance Criteria

**Schema**

- **AC-1** Given a freshly migrated database, when introspecting `repair_records`, then a `duplicated_repair_id` column exists (nullable Integer) with a FK to `repair_records.id` (ON DELETE SET NULL) and an index `ix_repair_records_duplicated_repair_id`.

- **AC-2** Given a RepairRecord A with `duplicated_repair_id = B.id`, when B is deleted from the database, then A.duplicated_repair_id is NULL (and A is preserved).

- **AC-3** Given a RepairRecord A with `duplicated_repair_id = B.id`, when accessing `A.duplicated_repair`, then it returns the RepairRecord B instance.

**Service layer — happy path & errors**

- **AC-4** Given an open repair R1 and another open repair R2 on the same equipment, when `update_repair_record(R1.id, updated_by='u', author_id=u.id, status='Closed - Duplicate', duplicated_repair_id=R2.id)` is called, then R1.status becomes `'Closed - Duplicate'`, R1.duplicated_repair_id becomes R2.id, a timeline entry of type `duplicated_repair_id_change` is created with `new_value == str(R2.id)`, and `repair_record.updated` is emitted in the mutation log with `changes['duplicated_repair_id'] == [None, str(R2.id)]`.

- **AC-5** Given an open repair R1 with current `status != 'Closed - Duplicate'`, when `update_repair_record(R1.id, status='Closed - Duplicate', ...)` is called WITHOUT `duplicated_repair_id`, then `ValidationError` is raised with a message containing `'Closed - Duplicate'` and `duplicated_repair_id`, and R1 is unchanged. (Validation fires only on real transitions; idempotent re-submissions of the same status are handled by AC-11.)

- **AC-6** Given an open repair R1, when `update_repair_record(R1.id, status='Closed - Duplicate', duplicated_repair_id=R1.id, ...)` is called, then `ValidationError` is raised with "cannot be a duplicate of itself".

- **AC-7** Given repair R1 on equipment E1 and repair R2 on equipment E2, when `update_repair_record(R1.id, status='Closed - Duplicate', duplicated_repair_id=R2.id, ...)` is called, then `ValidationError` is raised with "must be on the same equipment".

- **AC-8** Given an open repair R1 and a non-existent id 99999, when `update_repair_record(R1.id, status='Closed - Duplicate', duplicated_repair_id=99999, ...)` is called, then `ValidationError` is raised with "Duplicated repair 99999 not found".

- **AC-9** Given a repair R1 with `status='Resolved'`, when `update_repair_record(R1.id, duplicated_repair_id=R2.id, ...)` is called without changing status, then `ValidationError` is raised with "may only be set when status is 'Closed - Duplicate'".

- **AC-10** Given a repair R1 with `status='Closed - Duplicate'` and `duplicated_repair_id=R2.id`, when `update_repair_record(R1.id, status='In Progress', ...)` is called, then R1.duplicated_repair_id becomes NULL, `audit_changes['duplicated_repair_id'] == [str(R2.id), None]`, and a `duplicated_repair_id_change` timeline entry is created with `new_value is None`.

- **AC-11** (Legacy carve-out) Given a repair R1 with `status='Closed - Duplicate'` and `duplicated_repair_id=None` (legacy data), when `update_repair_record(R1.id, status='Closed - Duplicate', specialist_description='x', ...)` is called (with `status` re-asserted by the form but unchanged from the record), then the call succeeds without raising `ValidationError` and R1.specialist_description equals `'x'`. This is the path the web edit form exercises whenever a staff member edits a legacy `Closed - Duplicate` record for any non-status field; Rule 3a's transition guard (`record.status != 'Closed - Duplicate'`) makes the idempotent re-assertion a no-op.

**Service layer — helper**

- **AC-12** Given a repair R1 on equipment E and three other repairs R2 (newest), R3, R4 (oldest) on E plus R5 on another equipment, when `list_duplicate_candidates(R1.id)` is called, then it returns `[R2, R3, R4]` in that order — R5 excluded (different equipment), R1 excluded (self).

- **AC-13** When `list_duplicate_candidates(99999)` is called with a non-existent id, then `ValidationError` is raised.

**Web UI**

- **AC-14** Given a logged-in technician fetches `/repairs/{id}/edit` for a repair whose status is `'In Progress'`, then the response HTML contains a `<div id="duplicate-block"` element with inline `style="display: none;"`.

- **AC-15** Given a logged-in technician fetches `/repairs/{id}/edit` for a repair whose status is `'Closed - Duplicate'` and `duplicated_repair_id` is set, then the duplicate-block has no `display: none` style AND the target repair's `<option>` carries `selected`.

- **AC-16** Given an open repair R1 and another repair R2 on the same equipment, when a staff client POSTs `/repairs/R1/edit` with form data `status='Closed - Duplicate'`, `duplicated_repair_id=R2.id`, then the response is `302` to `/repairs/R1`, `db.session.get(RepairRecord, R1.id).duplicated_repair_id == R2.id`, and a follow-up GET of `/repairs/R1` contains the string "Marked as duplicate of #{R2.id}".

- **AC-17** Given an open repair R1, when a staff client POSTs `/repairs/R1/edit` with `status='Closed - Duplicate'` and `duplicated_repair_id=0`, then the response is `200` (no redirect), a `flash` of category `danger` is rendered containing the service ValidationError message, and `db.session.get(RepairRecord, R1.id).status` is unchanged.

- **AC-18** Given a repair R1 with `status='Closed - Duplicate'` and `duplicated_repair_id=R2.id`, when a staff client POSTs `/repairs/R1/edit` with `status='In Progress'` (no duplicated_repair_id in the form), then the response is `302`, `R1.duplicated_repair_id` is `None`, the detail page no longer shows the "Marked as duplicate of" row, AND an `info` flash containing the string `'Duplicate link cleared'` is rendered on the redirected detail page.

**Slack**

- **AC-19** Given two open repairs R1 and R2 on the same equipment, when `build_repair_action_modal(R1)` is called, then the returned view contains a block with `block_id == 'duplicate_block'` whose `static_select` options include an entry with `value == str(R2.id)` and `text.text` starting with `f'#{R2.id} [{R2.status}]'`.

- **AC-20** Given a repair R1 that is the only repair on its equipment, when `build_repair_action_modal(R1)` is called, then NO block in the returned view has `block_id == 'duplicate_block'` AND the `status_block`'s options do NOT include any option with `value == 'Closed - Duplicate'`.

- **AC-21** When `build_repair_create_modal(equipment_options, user_options)` is called, then no option in the `status_block` has `value == 'Closed - Duplicate'`.

- **AC-22** Given an open repair R1 and another R2 on the same equipment, when the registered `view:repair_action_submission` handler is invoked with `private_metadata=str(R1.id)`, action=`set_status`, status=`Closed - Duplicate`, and `duplicate_block.duplicated_repair_id.selected_option.value=str(R2.id)`, then `update_repair_record` is called with `status='Closed - Duplicate'` and `duplicated_repair_id=R2.id`, `ack()` is called with no kwargs, and an ephemeral confirmation is posted.

- **AC-23** Given an open repair R1 and another R2 on the same equipment, when the action-modal handler is invoked with `action=set_status`, status=`Closed - Duplicate`, and no `duplicate_block.duplicated_repair_id.selected_option`, then `ack` is called with `response_action='errors'` and `errors['duplicate_block']` set to the "Selecting which repair this duplicates is required." string, and `update_repair_record` is NOT called.

- **AC-24** (Stale-modal race) Given an open repair R1, when (a) `build_repair_action_modal(R1)` is called and the resulting view contains an option for R2; (b) R2 is then deleted from the database in another session; (c) the Slack handler is invoked with that view's submitted state (action=`set_status`, status=`Closed - Duplicate`, `duplicate_block.duplicated_repair_id.selected_option.value == str(R2.id)`); then the service raises `ValidationError("Duplicated repair {R2.id} not found")`, the handler calls `ack(response_action='errors', errors={'action_block': <message>})`, R1 is unchanged, and no ephemeral confirmation is posted. (This race is acceptable — the service is the source of truth — but the test asserts the failure surfaces cleanly rather than crashing the handler.)

**Cross-cutting**

- **AC-25** `make lint` reports no new violations after all changes.
- **AC-26** `make test` passes with the new tests included.

## Additional Context

### Dependencies

- **No new third-party dependencies.** Uses existing Flask-SQLAlchemy 3.x self-referential FK support (`remote_side=[id]`), Flask-WTF `SelectField(coerce=int)`, Slack Bolt SDK `views_open` / view-submission handlers, Alembic `batch_alter_table`.
- **Service-internal dependency:** `build_repair_action_modal` becomes coupled to `repair_service.list_duplicate_candidates`. This is acceptable since `forms.py` already imports models (line 173, line 197) and the Slack layer already has a hard service dependency.
- **Database:** requires MariaDB up + migration applied before service-layer code is exercised against the real DB. SQLite-in-memory testing config picks up the column automatically via `db.create_all()`.

### Testing Strategy

- **Unit tests (model layer):** model column nullability, FK behavior (with SQLite `PRAGMA foreign_keys=ON` enabled per Task 3), relationship loading. See Task 3.
- **Unit tests (service layer):** `TestListDuplicateCandidates` (4 cases) + `TestDuplicatedRepairId` (8 cases covering AC-4 through AC-11, including the legacy carve-out's transition-guard semantics from Technical Decisions §3). See Task 6.
- **Unit tests (Slack forms):** modal-builder dict-shape assertions (AC-19, AC-20, AC-21) + label-budget assertion (no option text exceeds 75 chars). See Task 16.
- **Integration tests (Slack handlers):** action-modal submission via `_register_and_capture` helper with MagicMock client (AC-22, AC-23, AC-24 stale-modal race). See Task 16.
- **Integration tests (web views):** Flask test client POSTs with `follow_redirects=False` for redirect+DB-state assertions; `follow_redirects=True` for the silent-clear flash assertion (AC-18). Covers AC-14 through AC-18. See Task 12.
- **Manual smoke test:** after `make run` + `make worker`, exercise the full flow in a browser: create two repairs on one equipment, transition one to `Closed - Duplicate` with the other as target, verify the detail page link, verify the timeline entry, then transition back to `In Progress` and verify the info flash about the cleared duplicate link. Then via Slack (if `SLACK_SOCKET_MODE_CONNECT=true`): `/esb-repair`, pick the repair, `Set Status → Closed - Duplicate`, pick the duplicate, verify ephemeral confirmation and DB state, then transition back and verify the second-line ephemeral about the cleared link.

### Notes

- **No backfill of legacy data.** Any rows that already have `status='Closed - Duplicate'` will have `duplicated_repair_id=NULL` post-migration. Staff who want to retroactively record the link can edit those records via the web UI now that the field is exposed. The legacy carve-out (AC-11) means editing such a row for unrelated fields doesn't force a re-link.
- **No CHECK constraint.** Coupling status and `duplicated_repair_id` at the DB layer would be ideal, but MariaDB CHECK enforcement of cross-column rules has been spotty historically, and the rest of this codebase enforces invariants in the service layer. We follow that precedent.
- **No reverse-direction view.** "Which repairs are duplicates of this one?" is not in scope. A future story can add a `backref` on the relationship and a section on the detail page; the data is fully queryable as soon as this is shipped.
- **Cycle detection deferred.** Duplicate chains (R1 → R2 → R3 → R1) are operationally harmless — staff would notice while clicking through — and adding cycle detection complicates the validation logic for no real benefit.
- **Slack 3-modal-stack avoided.** The original design instinct was to push a second modal after the user selects `Closed - Duplicate`. Single-modal with always-visible-but-optional fields (matching the existing ETA/status/note pattern) is simpler, has no race window between modal pushes, and is consistent with the codebase.
- **Migration revision id:** Alembic generates this; the slug portion should be `add_duplicated_repair_id`. CLAUDE.md documents the container-IP workflow.
- **Issue tracking:** This work resolves [#43](https://github.com/jantman/equipment-status-board/issues/43). Commits must be prefixed `Issue #43:` per repo convention.
