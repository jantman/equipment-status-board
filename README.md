A web application for tracking equipment status and coordinating repairs at community makerspaces, originally developed for [Decatur Makers](https://decaturmakers.org). Provides a single source of truth so members know what's working, technicians know what needs fixing, and staff can coordinate it all.

## Features

- **Equipment Registry & Status Tracking** — Maintain a registry of all equipment organized by area, with live green/yellow/red status derived from open repair records
- **Repair Workflow** — 10-status repair lifecycle (New through Resolved/Closed) with append-only timeline preserving diagnostic notes, photos, and assignment history
- **QR Code Equipment Pages** — Scan a QR sticker on any piece of equipment to instantly see its status, known issues, documentation, and report a problem
- **Kanban Board** — Visual overview of all active repairs by status with aging indicators to spot stuck items
- **Kiosk Display** — Large-screen auto-refreshing status grid for wall-mounted monitors in the space
- **Static Status Page** — Lightweight externally hosted page for checking status from anywhere (pushes to local directory, S3, or Google Cloud Storage)
- **Slack Integration** — Report problems, check status, create and update repairs via slash commands (`/esb-report`, `/esb-status`, `/esb-repair`, `/esb-update`); automated notifications for new reports, status changes, and more
- **Role-Based Access** — Three user types: Members (public, no login), Technicians (repair management), Staff (full administration)
