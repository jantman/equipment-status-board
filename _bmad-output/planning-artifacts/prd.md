# Product Requirements Document - Equipment Status Board

**Author:** Jantman
**Date:** 2026-02-13

## Executive Summary

The Equipment Status Board (ESB) is an on-premises web application for Decatur Makers, a 501(c)(3) non-profit makerspace with approximately 600 members who have 24/7 facility access. The ESB solves a critical gap: members have no reliable way to know whether equipment is operational before visiting the space. Status information is scattered across Slack channels, word of mouth, and handwritten signs -- leading to wasted trips, frustration, and reduced trust in the organization.

The ESB provides a centralized system for tracking equipment status, coordinating repairs between the part-time Makerspace Manager and volunteer Technicians, consolidating equipment documentation, and communicating with members through multiple channels: in-space kiosk displays, a public static status page, QR code-driven equipment pages, and a full-featured Slack App.

**Key differentiators:**
- Built for the makerspace model: volunteer Technicians, a part-time Manager, and a Slack-first community
- Physical-digital bridge via QR codes: every piece of equipment becomes a gateway to status, documentation, and problem reporting
- Slack as a first-class interface: full two-way integration meets the community where they already communicate
- On-premises and volunteer-maintainable: Docker container on local servers, no cloud dependency for core functionality, no dedicated IT staff required

**Target users:**
- **Members (~600):** Check equipment status before visiting; report problems via QR code or Slack
- **Volunteer Technicians (handful):** Manage repair queue; log diagnostic work; coordinate via Slack
- **Staff/Makerspace Manager (4):** Kanban overview of all repairs; equipment registry management; user provisioning

**Project context:** Open-source volunteer project. Python backend, MariaDB database, Docker deployment. Greenfield build with defined stakeholder requirements.

## Success Criteria

### User Success

- **Members check before visiting:** Members develop a habit of checking equipment status (via static page, Slack bot, or kiosk) before making trips to the space. Validated through member surveys and word of mouth. Optional: NewRelic analytics on static page post-MVP.
- **Frictionless problem reporting:** Members who encounter broken equipment report it via QR code or Slack without needing to ask "who do I tell?" -- the path is obvious and takes under 2 minutes.
- **Trust in status accuracy:** Members trust that the status information is current. When the board says "green," they believe it.

### Business Success

- **Reduced status inquiries in Slack:** Fewer "is the X working?" messages in area channels -- the ESB becomes the answer to that question.
- **Repair coordination replaces ad hoc messaging:** The Makerspace Manager uses the Kanban board as her primary coordination tool instead of tracking repairs mentally or through scattered Slack threads.
- **Volunteer time is well-spent:** Technicians report that the repair queue helps them find useful work and that their diagnostic notes prevent duplicated effort.

### Technical Success

- **System stays current:** Equipment status displayed across all channels (kiosk, static page, Slack) accurately reflects the latest known state.
- **Maintainable by volunteers:** The system can be administered, updated, and restarted by volunteers with general technology experience -- no dedicated IT staff required.
- **Reliability is "Monday-fix" grade:** Server downtime is not a crisis. The system is reliable enough for daily use but doesn't require on-call support or HA infrastructure.

### Measurable Outcomes

- Most equipment issues result in a repair record being created (qualitative threshold -- not 100%, but the norm)
- Repair records include diagnostic notes that are useful to the next person
- The Makerspace Manager reports improved visibility into what's broken and what's stuck
- Member surveys indicate awareness of and trust in the status board within 3 months of launch

## User Journeys

### Sarah's Journey: The Weekend Woodworker (Member)

**Who she is:** Sarah drives 20 minutes to Decatur Makers 2-3 times per week, primarily using the woodshop. She's not deeply technical and uses Slack intermittently. She's a good community member but won't jump through hoops to do the right thing.

**Opening Scene:** It's Saturday morning. Sarah has a half-built bookshelf project waiting at the space and plans to spend the afternoon on the SawStop and the planer. She's been burned before -- drove over last month only to find the SawStop had a tripped brake cartridge and nobody had replaced it. Wasted trip. She complained in Slack but isn't sure anyone saw it.

**Rising Action:** Before heading out, she pulls up the ESB status page on her phone. Green across the board in Woodshop except the planer -- yellow, "Dust collection hose disconnected, usable with shop vac." She can work with that. She drives over with confidence.

At the space, she's using the SawStop when she notices the fence isn't tracking square. She spots the QR code sticker on the machine, scans it with her phone. The page shows the SawStop is currently green, lists a link to the owner's manual, and has a simple form below. She taps in her name, types "Fence not tracking square -- cuts are off by about 1/8 inch at the end," leaves severity as "Not Sure," and hits submit. Done in 90 seconds. The confirmation tells her it's been posted to #woodshop and #oops on Slack.

**Climax:** Two days later, Sarah's back at the space. She scans the SawStop QR code out of curiosity -- there's a repair record showing Marcus looked at it, adjusted the fence alignment, and confirmed it's cutting true. Green. She doesn't need to ask anyone, track down a Slack message, or wonder. The information is just *there*.

**Resolution:** Checking the status page becomes Sarah's Saturday morning habit. She trusts it. When she encounters problems, she reports them because it's easy and she can see that reports actually lead to fixes. She tells other members about the QR codes.

### Marcus's Journey: The Volunteer Technician

**Who he is:** Marcus is a retired engineer who volunteers a few hours per week at Decatur Makers. He has deep equipment expertise but limited time. He works from his phone while standing in the workshop.

**Opening Scene:** Marcus has a free Tuesday afternoon and wants to put in a couple hours helping the space. In the old days, he'd show up and wander around looking for broken things, or text Dana to ask what needs attention. Half the time he'd start diagnosing something another volunteer had already looked at -- wasted effort.

**Rising Action:** He pulls up the ESB repair queue on his phone. Three open items: the drill press is Down ("motor makes grinding noise, won't start"), the band saw is Degraded ("blade tension adjustment stuck"), and a 3D printer has a "Parts Received" tag -- filament sensor replacement arrived yesterday. He picks the drill press because motors are his thing.

At the space, he opens the repair record on his phone. There's a note from another Technician last week: "Checked power connections, all good. Didn't get further -- suspect motor bearings or controller board." Marcus appreciates not having to repeat that diagnostic work. He digs in, confirms it's the motor controller, and updates the record from his phone: "Motor controller board failed. Need replacement -- see parts list." He sets the status to "Parts Needed," adds a photo of the model number plate, and adds the specific part to the notes.

**Climax:** He spots the 3D printer with "Parts Received" -- the filament sensor is sitting on the bench. Since he's already here, he swaps it in, tests it, and marks that record "Resolved" with a note: "Installed new filament sensor, tested with PLA and PETG, both detect correctly." Two fixes progressed in one visit, zero duplicated effort.

**Resolution:** Marcus checks the repair queue whenever he has free time. His volunteer hours feel productive because he always knows what needs attention, what's already been tried, and where he can make the most impact. His detailed notes become the institutional knowledge that used to exist only in people's heads.

### Dana's Journey: The Makerspace Manager (Staff)

**Who she is:** Dana is the part-time Makerspace Manager. She juggles equipment maintenance alongside running classes, managing the space, and coordinating volunteers. She's the bridge between Technicians doing the work and the organizational resources needed to support them.

**Opening Scene:** Monday morning. Dana used to start her week piecing together what happened over the weekend from scattered Slack messages, texts from Marcus, and sticky notes on machines. Equipment status lived in her head, and things fell through the cracks -- especially parts that needed ordering and repairs that got stuck.

**Rising Action:** She opens the ESB Kanban board. At a glance: two items in "New" (weekend reports from members), one in "Parts Needed" (Marcus's drill press motor controller from Tuesday), one in "Parts Ordered" (laser tube she ordered last week), and the band saw still sitting in "New" from five days ago -- that's been stuck too long.

She clicks into the drill press record, sees Marcus's detailed diagnosis and the part photo. She searches for the motor controller, finds it on the vendor site, orders it, and updates the status to "Parts Ordered" with the order number and expected delivery. For the stuck band saw, she messages Marcus on Slack to see if he can look at it this week.

**Climax:** Thursday, the motor controller arrives. Dana marks it "Parts Received" in the system. Marcus gets a notification, comes in Friday, installs it, and marks it "Resolved." The drill press went from member report to fixed in 10 days, with a clear trail of every step. Dana didn't have to chase anyone or remember anything -- the system surfaced what needed her attention.

**Resolution:** The Monday morning Kanban check replaces Dana's mental checklist. Stuck items are immediately visible by how long they've been in a column. Parts ordering is structured instead of ad hoc. She spends less time tracking status and more time actually managing the space. When the board asks "what's the state of the woodshop?" at a staff meeting, she pulls up the dashboard instead of guessing.

### Journey-to-Requirements Traceability

Each journey maps to specific functional requirement areas:

- **Sarah (Member):** Status Display & Member Access (FR27-33), Problem Reporting (FR22-26), Slack Integration (FR40, FR43)
- **Marcus (Technician):** Repair Records (FR11-21), Role-Based Experiences (FR35), Slack Integration (FR41-42)
- **Dana (Staff/Manager):** Equipment Registry (FR1-10), Role-Based Experiences (FR36-37), User Management (FR45-51), Slack Integration (FR38-39, FR44)
- **Cross-cutting:** Multi-channel status delivery, role-based access, photo/video uploads

## Web Application Specific Requirements

### Architecture Decisions

- Multi-page application with server-rendered HTML
- Python backend (framework TBD during architecture phase)
- MariaDB database
- Docker container deployment on local servers within the makerspace
- No public internet exposure for the main application; remote access via static page and Slack only

### Browser & Device Support

- Modern browsers only (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge -- current and previous major versions)
- All authenticated views must work on mobile devices (Technicians work from phones at the bench)
- Kiosk display optimized for large screens with stripped-down layout via URL parameter
- QR code landing pages optimized for mobile-first (phone scanning)

### Refresh Strategy

- Kiosk auto-refresh via 60-second polling
- Authenticated views use manual refresh or standard page navigation
- Static status page regenerated and pushed on status change events

### Key Implementation Factors

- Photo/video upload handling on local filesystem (configurable size limit, default 500MB)
- QR code generation for equipment pages
- Static page generation and push to cloud hosting on status change
- Slack App integration (OAuth, event subscriptions, interactive components)
- Role-based access control (Member/Technician/Staff) with local accounts
- All mutation requests logged in JSON to STDOUT for data reconstruction
- No SEO requirements -- internal tool
- No real-time/WebSocket requirements

## Project Scoping & Phased Development

### Strategy

**Approach:** Deliver the complete v1.0 feature set as specified by stakeholders. This is an open-source volunteer project for a 501(c)(3) non-profit makerspace with defined requirements. Scope is driven by organizational needs, not market validation.

**Resource Model:** Volunteer open-source development. No dedicated team or timeline pressure -- quality and completeness over speed.

### v1.0 Scope

All three user journeys fully supported:
- Sarah (Member): status checking, QR code reporting, kiosk display, static page
- Marcus (Technician): repair queue, mobile-friendly record updates, diagnostic notes
- Dana (Staff/Manager): Kanban board, equipment registry, user management, parts workflow

Complete capability set: equipment registry, 10-status repair workflow, QR code pages, kiosk display, static status page, role-based experiences, full Slack App, local auth, Docker/MariaDB deployment, CI/CD with comprehensive tests.

### Phase 2 (Growth)

- Parts inventory with stock tracking, low-stock indicators, and ordering workflow (data model accommodated from day one)
- Consumable-specific routing to broader volunteer pool
- Smart Technician routing based on Area assignments and expertise
- NewRelic or similar analytics on the static status page
- Per-member notification preferences

### Phase 3 (Vision)

- Authentication provider integration (Slack OAuth or Neon One SSO)
- Reporting and analytics -- repair time trends, equipment reliability metrics, volunteer contribution tracking
- Automated equipment monitoring or IoT integration

### Risk Mitigation

**Technical Risks:**
- *Slack App complexity:* Mitigate by building the web UI first and adding Slack as a parallel interface to the same backend, not a separate system.
- *On-premises deployment:* Ensure graceful degradation if internet is unavailable (core app still works on local network).

**Operational Risks:**
- *Volunteer maintainability:* Docker deployment and clear documentation essential. The system must be restartable and debuggable by someone who didn't build it.
- *Data durability:* JSON mutation logging to STDOUT provides a data reconstruction path. Regular database backups documented as an operational procedure.

**Adoption Risks:**
- *Member awareness:* QR code stickers on equipment are the primary discovery mechanism. Physical deployment is a non-technical dependency.
- *Technician buy-in:* Slack integration meets Technicians where they already are -- the key adoption lever validating its inclusion in v1.0.

- **FR71:** Staff can view volunteer contribution tracking (repairs completed, notes added per Technician)

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance

- **NFR1:** Web UI pages load within standard web application response times (under 3 seconds on local network)
- **NFR2:** Kiosk display refreshes without visible flicker or layout shift during 60-second polling cycle
- **NFR3:** Static status page generation and push completes within 30 seconds of a status change event
- **NFR4:** The system supports concurrent usage by all active users (up to ~600 members, handful of Technicians/Staff) without degradation

### Security

- **NFR5:** Role-based access control enforced server-side -- unauthenticated users cannot access Technician or Staff functionality
- **NFR6:** Passwords stored using industry-standard hashing (never plaintext or reversible encryption)
- **NFR7:** Session tokens are not predictable or reusable after expiration
- **NFR8:** Public-facing pages (QR code pages, kiosk, static page) do not expose internal system details, user credentials, or administrative functionality
- **NFR9:** No encryption at rest required -- data is not sensitive and the server is on a private local network

### Integration

- **NFR10:** The Slack App integration operates independently from core web UI functionality -- Slack outages do not prevent web-based operations
- **NFR11:** When Slack is unreachable (API errors, network outage), the system queues outbound notifications for delivery when connectivity is restored
- **NFR12:** The static page push mechanism handles cloud hosting unavailability gracefully (retry with backoff, log failures)
- **NFR13:** The Slack App requires a paid Slack plan (Pro or higher)

### Reliability

- **NFR14:** Core application (web UI, database) operates fully on the local network with no internet dependency
- **NFR15:** The system recovers cleanly from restart (Docker container restart, server reboot) without data loss or corrupted state
- **NFR16:** All data-mutating operations are logged to STDOUT in sufficient detail to reconstruct data if the database is corrupted or lost
- **NFR17:** The system does not require high availability infrastructure, monitoring, or on-call support -- "Monday-fix" reliability grade

### Accessibility

- **NFR18:** Follow semantic HTML best practices (proper heading hierarchy, form labels, alt text)
- **NFR19:** Maintain sufficient color contrast for status indicators (green/yellow/red must be distinguishable; do not rely solely on color)
- **NFR20:** Support keyboard navigation for all authenticated workflows
- **NFR21:** No formal WCAG compliance target -- best practices, not certification
