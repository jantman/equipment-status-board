# Tech-Spec: Configurable Sort Order for Areas

**Created:** 2026-05-12
**GitHub Issue:** #45 — "Sorting of areas on status pages"

## Overview

### Problem Statement

Issue #45: All multi-area views in the application — the public status dashboard, the kiosk display, the static status page export, the Areas admin table, and area dropdowns on equipment forms — currently render areas in alphabetical order by name. Staff at Decatur Makers want to control the order so that areas appear in a meaningful sequence (e.g., reflecting the physical layout or priority of the makerspace) rather than the accident of their names.

### Solution

Add a persistent integer `sort_order` column to the `areas` table (default `0`, NOT NULL). Allow staff to edit it through the existing Areas admin form. Replace the two `order_by(Area.name)` clauses in `equipment_service.list_areas()` and `status_service.get_area_status_dashboard()` with `order_by(Area.sort_order, Area.name)`. Because the status dashboard, kiosk view, static page export, and all area dropdowns funnel through one of these two service functions, every multi-area surface inherits the new ordering with no further changes.

### Scope

**In Scope:**
- Schema migration adding `areas.sort_order` (integer, NOT NULL, default 0).
- `Area.sort_order` model attribute.
- `sort_order` field on `AreaCreateForm` and `AreaEditForm`.
- Admin areas list page sorted by `(sort_order, name)` and showing the value.
- Reordering of `equipment_service.list_areas()` and `status_service.get_area_status_dashboard()` queries.
- Audit logging of `sort_order` changes through existing `log_mutation` plumbing.
- Updated tests covering the new ordering, form behavior, and migration default.

**Out of Scope:**
- Drag-and-drop reorder UI. A numeric input is sufficient for this iteration.
- Per-view custom orderings (one global order serves all surfaces).
- Reordering of equipment within an area.
- Reordering of archived areas (admin still lists active areas only; archived areas are not exposed). The `archive_area()` service function does not touch `sort_order`, so values are preserved across archive/unarchive cycles by design.
- Single-area routes that render only one area at a time: `/kiosk/<area_id>` (`esb/views/public.py:40`, `kiosk_area`) and the per-equipment public page (`esb/views/public.py:96`, `equipment_page`). These don't iterate areas, so ordering is meaningless.

**In-scope surfaces that inherit the new ordering automatically** (not requiring per-surface changes, but each needs a test): the public status dashboard, kiosk display, static page export, admin areas list, equipment registry filter dropdown, equipment create/edit area dropdowns, repair queue area filter, repair form area dropdowns, **and** the Slack `/esb-status` summary text rendered by `esb/slack/forms.py:format_status_summary` (called from `esb/slack/handlers.py:288` via `get_area_status_dashboard()`).

## Context for Development

### Codebase Patterns

- **Service layer is authoritative.** Views and templates do not touch `db.session` directly — they call functions in `esb/services/*.py`. The two area queries to update both live in services: `equipment_service.list_areas()` (esb/services/equipment_service.py:22) and `status_service.get_area_status_dashboard()` (esb/services/status_service.py:186; the `order_by(Area.name)` clause is at line 216).
- **Two service queries feed every multi-area HTML surface — but Slack `/esb-repair` does its own sort.** Public dashboard (esb/views/public.py:27), kiosk (esb/views/public.py:36), and static page export (esb/services/static_page_service.py:50) all call `status_service.get_area_status_dashboard()`. Admin areas list (esb/views/admin.py:168), equipment-form dropdowns (esb/views/equipment.py:43, :79, :167), and repair-form dropdowns (esb/views/repairs.py:115) all call `equipment_service.list_areas()`. Reordering those two queries propagates to every HTML consumer transitively. **However**, `esb/slack/forms.py:581` (`build_repair_dispatcher_modal`) does its own in-Python `for area_name in sorted(buckets):` loop over area names — this is a separate code path that the two service-query changes do NOT reach. See Task 4b for the explicit fix. The single-equipment public page (`esb/views/public.py:96`, `equipment_page`) does NOT use either query — it calls `status_service.compute_equipment_status()` for one item at a time and is unaffected by ordering changes.
- **All admin mutations go through `log_mutation()`.** `equipment_service.update_area()` (esb/services/equipment_service.py:98-137) computes a `changes` dict (per-field old→new lists) and emits `log_mutation('area.updated', updated_by, {..., 'changes': changes})` — but the emission is **guarded by `if changes:`** at line 129, so a no-op edit produces no log entry. `sort_order` joins this pattern unchanged: only append to `changes` when `area.sort_order != sort_order`. The existing test `test_no_log_when_no_changes` (`tests/test_services/test_equipment_service.py:271`) is the model for the same-value regression assertion.
- **Admin routes are staff-only.** Every route in the Area Management block in `esb/views/admin.py` is decorated with `@role_required('staff')`. No change here.
- **Form classes are minimal and duplicated.** `AreaCreateForm` and `AreaEditForm` (esb/forms/equipment_forms.py:22 and :30) intentionally share field definitions rather than inherit — keep that pattern; add the same `sort_order` field to both. Use `IntegerField` from `wtforms` and `NumberRange(min=0, max=999999)` + `Optional()` validators from `wtforms.validators`.
- **WTForms empty-string handling requires view-layer coercion.** `Optional()` makes the field tolerant of blank input (no validation error), but **does not coerce blank input to the field's `default`**. Empirically verified: with `Optional()` + `default=0`, an empty-string POST (`sort_order=''`, which is what the browser sends when the user clears the rendered field) yields `form.sort_order.data is None`; only an *absent* form key yields `data == 0` (the default). The view handler MUST therefore convert `None → 0` explicitly before calling the service: `sort_order_value = form.sort_order.data if form.sort_order.data is not None else 0`. The form-side `filters=` parameter cannot fix this because `IntegerField.process_formdata` runs `int('')` (which raises `ValueError`) before filters apply.
- **Templates iterate `areas` differently across surfaces.** All four area-rendering templates (`admin/areas.html`, `public/status_dashboard.html`, `public/kiosk.html`, `public/static_page.html`) loop over an `areas` collection produced by a service function, **but only the kiosk display filters empties with `selectattr('equipment')`** — `public/status_dashboard.html:39` and `public/static_page.html` iterate `areas` directly with no filter. The kiosk dropdown section in `status_dashboard.html:20` does use `selectattr`, but the main per-area list does not. Implication: the new ordering propagates through both the populated and empty-area paths; whichever surfaces show empty areas today will continue to, in the new sort order. Only the admin areas template needs a new display column.
- **Slack `/esb-status` is also a multi-area surface.** `esb/slack/forms.py:format_status_summary` (called from `esb/slack/handlers.py:288`) renders one Slack line per area from the same `get_area_status_dashboard()` result, so the new ordering flows through the Slack summary too. This was not flagged in the original Out-of-Scope list but is included in scope here for completeness — no Slack code changes are needed, only a regression test.
- **Migrations use Alembic batch mode.** Existing migrations (e.g., `migrations/versions/2e0d6d8be171_add_areas_table.py`) wrap schema changes in `op.batch_alter_table(...)` for MariaDB compatibility. New migration must use the same pattern when adding the column, and use `server_default='0'` so existing rows backfill before the NOT NULL constraint takes effect.

### Existing Tests Affected (Investigation Findings)

- `tests/test_services/test_equipment_service.py:18-30` (`test_returns_active_areas_ordered`) — assertion `names == ['Electronics Lab', 'Metal Shop', 'Woodshop']` still passes because all three areas keep `sort_order=0` (model default) and the secondary key is still `name`. **However**, the test now passes *for an uninteresting reason* (it never exercises the new compound ordering), so a separate new test `test_orders_by_sort_order_then_name` MUST be added with explicit mixed `sort_order` values. Also update both the service docstring at `esb/services/equipment_service.py:23` *and* the test docstring at `tests/test_services/test_equipment_service.py:19` to mention `(sort_order, name)`.
- `tests/test_services/test_equipment_service.py:207-296` (`TestUpdateArea`) — there are seven existing positional call sites to `update_area(area_id, name, slack_channel, updated_by)`: lines ~214, 223, 233, 242, 249, 258, 277. The proposed `update_area` signature change MUST be backward-compatible (see Task 5: use keyword-only `sort_order: int | None = None` argument appended after `updated_by`). With that signature, no existing test call site needs editing.
- `tests/test_services/test_equipment_service.py:271-283` (`test_no_log_when_no_changes`) — this test asserts that updating an area with the same `name`/`slack_channel`/`channel` emits no `area.updated` log entry. Model the new no-op-on-sort_order regression test on this one.
- `tests/test_services/test_status_service.py:192-272` covers `get_area_status_dashboard()`. The existing `test_multiple_areas_sorted_by_name` (`tests/test_services/test_status_service.py:266`) asserts areas are returned in alphabetical name order — **its docstring "Areas are returned sorted by name" becomes a lie after this change.** Update the docstring to mention `(sort_order, name)` and either retain it as the all-zero-sort case or supersede it with a new test that uses explicit mixed values. Then add a new test `test_orders_areas_by_sort_order_then_name` covering the compound ordering with explicit values.
- `tests/test_views/test_admin_views.py:606-714` covers `TestCreateAreaPost` and `TestEditArea` POST flows. Each existing test omits the `sort_order` form key. With `Optional()` + `default=0` (see Task 6), absent-key submissions resolve cleanly to 0, so no existing test payloads need changes. **However**, this property MUST be verified by an explicit new test (AC 10).
- `tests/test_views/test_admin_views.py:923-968` (`TestAreaMutationLogging`) — extend with two new tests: (a) editing only `sort_order` produces an `area.updated` log entry whose `changes` dict has a `sort_order` key; (b) re-saving the same `sort_order` value produces **no** `area.updated` entry (couples to the `if changes:` guard in `update_area`).
- Slack tests in `tests/test_slack/test_forms.py:408-514` consume `get_area_status_dashboard()` output but assert on per-area content, not ordering. Add a small new test that creates three areas with mixed `sort_order`, equipment in each, then renders `format_status_summary(...)` and asserts the line order matches `(sort_order, name)`.

### Technical Decisions

- **Numeric input over drag-and-drop.** A simple `IntegerField` with default `0` keeps the UI scope small and matches the surrounding admin form aesthetic. Ties are broken by `name ASC`, so leaving every area at `0` preserves today's purely-alphabetical ordering for users who don't opt in.
- **`Optional()` + `default=0` + view-layer `None → 0` coercion.** Together they solve the three input cases for `sort_order`: (a) absent form key → `data == 0` (default applies via the absent-key path); (b) empty string from cleared form → `data is None` (then view coerces to `0`); (c) explicit integer string → `data == int(value)`. `Optional()` alone does NOT coerce empty-string to the default — that is a WTForms semantic confirmed empirically. The view-layer `if data is None else 0` is therefore mandatory and cannot be removed without re-introducing the empty-string crash described under "WTForms empty-string handling" in Codebase Patterns.
- **`NumberRange(min=0, max=999999)` bounds the field.** Prevents accidental fat-finger overflow into MariaDB's signed `INT` range (max `2,147,483,647`). The choice of `999999` is intentionally far below the DB limit, leaves headroom for future use, and is enforced both by the WTForms validator (server-side) and by the HTML `max="999999"` attribute on the rendered `<input type="number">` (client-side hint).
- **`update_area` uses a keyword-only `sort_order: int | None = None` sentinel.** Preserves backward compatibility with all seven existing positional call sites in `TestUpdateArea` (which would silently break with any positional insertion). When `sort_order is None`, the function leaves the field untouched; when an int is provided, the standard `if area.sort_order != sort_order:` diff check populates `changes`. The view layer always supplies `form.sort_order.data`, so the sentinel branch is only used by test code that hasn't been extended.
- **Defensive `int()` cast at the service-layer boundary.** Both `create_area` and `update_area` coerce `sort_order` to `int(sort_order)` before assignment. WTForms' `IntegerField` already returns `int`, but if a future caller passes string `'7'` from a JSON API or other source, this coercion prevents silent type drift in the `log_mutation` payload (where `[old, new]` would become `[0, '7']`).
- **NOT NULL with `server_default='0'`.** Avoids three-valued sort logic and makes the Alembic migration backfill atomic — without `server_default`, the `add_column(... nullable=False)` would fail on rows that have no value at the moment the constraint takes effect. `default=0` at the ORM layer covers Python-driven inserts.
- **Compound `ORDER BY (sort_order, name)`.** Stable, deterministic, no surprises for areas that share a sort value; alphabetical remains the secondary key so today's behavior is the limit case.
- **No new index — explicit filesort trade-off.** The existing `ix_areas_name` index (created by `migrations/versions/2e0d6d8be171_add_areas_table.py:31`) covers `name` alone, so MariaDB cannot use it to satisfy `ORDER BY sort_order, name` — it will fall back to a `Using filesort`. This is acceptable here because the `areas` table is tiny (a handful of rows at Decatur Makers, with no production seed data growing it). Revisit if the table ever grows substantially; a composite index `(sort_order, name)` is the obvious mitigation.
- **`sort_order` is preserved across archive/unarchive cycles by design.** `equipment_service.archive_area()` (esb/services/equipment_service.py:140-161) only flips `is_archived`; it does not touch any other field. The new `sort_order` is left intact, so unarchiving an area restores its previous sort position automatically. This is intentional; a test in `TestArchiveArea` should pin the behavior.
- **Downgrade is structurally reversible but data-destroying.** `flask db downgrade` runs `batch_op.drop_column('sort_order')`, which removes the column and all user-set values. Re-running `upgrade` afterwards repopulates every row with `0`, not the previous values. This is acceptable for emergency rollback but should not be used as a casual "edit then revert" tool.
- **Service layer is the single ordering authority.** Touching only the two service queries propagates the new ordering to every consumer (admin list, public dashboard, kiosk, static export, equipment-form dropdowns, repair-form dropdowns, Slack `/esb-status`) without per-template changes.

## Implementation Plan

### Tasks

Tasks are ordered by dependency: schema → model → service signature/queries → forms → views → templates → tests. Within each task, the **File**, **Action**, and **Notes** fields are precise enough for a fresh agent to implement without re-reading conversation history.

- [ ] **Task 1: Add `sort_order` column to the `Area` model.**
  - File: `esb/models/area.py`
  - Action: Add `sort_order = db.Column(db.Integer, nullable=False, default=0, server_default='0')` between `is_archived` and `created_at`.
  - Notes: `server_default='0'` is essential — without it, Alembic's added column will not have a default at the DB level, and existing rows on MariaDB will violate NOT NULL during the upgrade. `default=0` covers ORM-level inserts.

- [ ] **Task 2: Generate the Alembic migration.**
  - File: `migrations/versions/<new_revision>_add_area_sort_order.py` (new file; revision auto-generated)
  - Action: Follow the CLAUDE.md "Database Migrations" procedure: ensure DB container is running, inspect its IP, then run `DATABASE_URL=mysql+pymysql://root:esb_dev_password@<ip>/esb flask db migrate -m "Add sort_order to areas"`. Accept the auto-generated body as-is — for `add_column` on MariaDB, plain `op.add_column('areas', sa.Column('sort_order', sa.Integer(), nullable=False, server_default='0'))` is correct and matches the project convention (the existing `2d0213647834` migration uses `op.batch_alter_table` only for `create_index`, not for column adds). Verify only:
    - `down_revision` is set to the current head (`'2d0213647834'` at the time of writing — `add_pending_notifications_table`).
    - The added column is `sa.Column('sort_order', sa.Integer(), nullable=False, server_default='0')` (the `server_default='0'` is critical — without it, the NOT NULL constraint fails on the existing rows).
    - `downgrade()` drops the column.
  - Notes: If the auto-generated migration omits `server_default='0'` (the autogenerator does not always emit defaults from model-level `default=` values), hand-edit it in. This is the only edit that may be required.

- [ ] **Task 3: Reorder `equipment_service.list_areas()`.**
  - File: `esb/services/equipment_service.py:22-28`
  - Action: Change `order_by(Area.name)` to `order_by(Area.sort_order, Area.name)`. Update the docstring from "ordered by name" to "ordered by `(sort_order, name)`".
  - Notes: Do not modify the filter — archived areas remain excluded.

- [ ] **Task 4: Reorder `status_service.get_area_status_dashboard()`.**
  - File: `esb/services/status_service.py` — function header at line 186; the `.order_by(Area.name)` clause at line 216 (inside the area-fetch query at lines 212-220).
  - Action: Change `.order_by(Area.name)` to `.order_by(Area.sort_order, Area.name)`. No other change to the function.
  - Notes: The dashboard's downstream consumers (public dashboard, kiosk, static page export, Slack `/esb-status` summary) all see the new order transitively.

- [ ] **Task 4b: Reorder `build_repair_dispatcher_modal` area buckets.**
  - File: `esb/slack/forms.py:554-596` (`build_repair_dispatcher_modal`)
  - Action: Replace the alphabetical sort of bucket keys with one that honors `(sort_order, name)`. Build a parallel lookup of area sort keys while iterating `open_records`, then sort buckets by that lookup:
    ```python
    buckets: dict[str, list] = {}
    area_sort_keys: dict[str, tuple[int, str]] = {}
    for record in open_records:
        area = record.equipment.area
        area_name = area.name if area else 'No Area'
        sort_order = area.sort_order if area else 0
        area_sort_keys[area_name] = (sort_order, area_name)
        buckets.setdefault(area_name, []).append(record)

    option_groups = []
    for area_name in sorted(buckets, key=lambda n: area_sort_keys[n]):
        ...
    ```
    Update the function docstring at lines 561-566 to describe the new ordering rule (replace "Across area groups, areas are presented alphabetically (A-Z)." with the `(sort_order, name)` rule).
  - Notes: Without this change, `/esb-repair` would still group areas alphabetically while every other multi-area surface respects `sort_order` — a confusing inconsistency for staff. Test impact:
    - The existing test `test_option_groups_by_area_sorted_alphabetically` (`tests/test_slack/test_forms.py:609`) MUST be updated: rename to `test_option_groups_by_area_sorted_by_sort_order_then_name`. Replace the existing fixture-area names (`'Alpha'`, `'Zoo'`) with three areas using mixed `sort_order` values so the assertion meaningfully distinguishes from alphabetical (e.g., names `'A'`, `'B'`, `'C'` with sort_order `10, 5, 5` → expected order `B, C, A`). Update the test's docstring to remove the stale `"AC 31"` reference and to describe the new `(sort_order, name)` ordering instead.
    - The "No Area" sentinel bucket in the function body is defensive (`equipment.area_id` is `NOT NULL`); no test path constructs equipment without an area, so the sentinel branch is intentionally untested.

- [ ] **Task 5: Extend `create_area` and `update_area` services to accept `sort_order`.**
  - File: `esb/services/equipment_service.py:71-95` (`create_area`) and `:98-137` (`update_area`)
  - Action:
    - **`create_area`**: change signature to `create_area(name, slack_channel, created_by, sort_order: int = 0)`. In the body, cast defensively (`sort_order = int(sort_order)`) before passing to the `Area(...)` constructor. Include `'sort_order': area.sort_order` in the `log_mutation('area.created', ...)` payload.
    - **`update_area`**: change signature to `update_area(area_id, name, slack_channel, updated_by, *, sort_order: int | None = None)` — keyword-only, appended after `updated_by`, sentinel default. This preserves backward compatibility with all seven existing positional call sites in `TestUpdateArea` (`tests/test_services/test_equipment_service.py` lines ~214, 223, 233, 242, 249, 258, 277), which would silently break if `sort_order` were inserted as a middle positional argument. In the body, after the existing `name` and `slack_channel` diff blocks, add:
      ```python
      if sort_order is not None:
          sort_order = int(sort_order)
          if area.sort_order != sort_order:
              changes['sort_order'] = [area.sort_order, sort_order]
              area.sort_order = sort_order
      ```
      The existing `if changes:` guard at line 129 already covers the no-op case — no separate guard needed.
  - Notes: The view layer (Task 7) always supplies `sort_order=int_value` (never `None`), so the sentinel branch in `update_area` only fires for legacy test code that omits the kwarg. This intentionally keeps the existing `TestUpdateArea` tests valid without modification.

- [ ] **Task 6: Add `sort_order` field to `AreaCreateForm` and `AreaEditForm`.**
  - File: `esb/forms/equipment_forms.py:22-35`
  - Action:
    1. **Add `IntegerField` to the existing wtforms import** at line 5:
       ```python
       from wtforms import (
           BooleanField,
           DateField,
           DecimalField,
           IntegerField,    # <-- new
           SelectField,
           StringField,
           SubmitField,
           TextAreaField,
       )
       ```
       Forgetting this is the most likely silent failure mode — the form module fails to load at import time with `NameError`.
    2. **Add `NumberRange` to the existing validators import** at line 14 (which already imports `Optional`):
       ```python
       from wtforms.validators import URL, DataRequired, Length, NumberRange, Optional
       ```
    3. Add to both `AreaCreateForm` and `AreaEditForm`, placed between `slack_channel` and `submit`:
       ```python
       sort_order = IntegerField(
           'Sort Order',
           default=0,
           validators=[
               Optional(),
               NumberRange(
                   min=0,
                   max=999999,
                   message='Sort order must be between 0 and 999999.',
               ),
           ],
       )
       ```
  - Notes: **`Optional()` does NOT coerce blank input to `default=0`** — empirically verified, blank input yields `data is None`. The view handler in Task 7 must convert `None → 0` before calling the service. The `max=999999` bound prevents accidental fat-finger overflow into MariaDB's signed-INT range (`2,147,483,647`). The HTML5 `max="999999"` attribute on the rendered input (Task 8) is advisory only — server-side `NumberRange(max=...)` is authoritative; tests using `client.post` bypass HTML5 validation entirely, which is the correct integration test surface.

- [ ] **Task 7: Wire `sort_order` through admin view handlers.**
  - File: `esb/views/admin.py:172-222`
  - Action: In **both** `create_area` and `edit_area`, after `form.validate_on_submit()` but before calling the service, materialize the coerced value:
    ```python
    sort_order_value = form.sort_order.data if form.sort_order.data is not None else 0
    ```
    Then pass `sort_order=sort_order_value` to `equipment_service.create_area(...)` / `equipment_service.update_area(...)`. The `AreaEditForm(obj=area)` instantiation already prefills the field from the model on GET; the explicit None coercion handles the empty-string POST case.
  - Notes: This coercion is the single fix for the WTForms empty-string-yields-None behavior. Without it, an empty-string POST would crash `create_area` (`int(None)` TypeError) and silently no-op `update_area` (sentinel branch) — see "WTForms empty-string handling" in Codebase Patterns. No changes to flash messages, redirects, or error handling.

- [ ] **Task 8: Render `sort_order` in the admin area form template.**
  - File: `esb/templates/admin/area_form.html`
  - Action: After the `slack_channel` field block, add an identical block for `sort_order`:
    ```jinja
    <div class="mb-3">
        <label for="sort_order" class="form-label">Sort Order</label>
        {{ form.sort_order(class="form-control" ~ (" is-invalid" if form.sort_order.errors else ""), type="number", min="0", max="999999", step="1") }}
        <div class="form-text">Lower numbers appear first on status pages. Ties are broken alphabetically. Leave at 0 for default alphabetical ordering.</div>
        {% for error in form.sort_order.errors %}
        <div class="invalid-feedback">{{ error }}</div>
        {% endfor %}
    </div>
    ```
  - Notes: `type="number" step="1"` enables a native spinner and integer-only client validation in modern browsers; `max="999999"` mirrors the server-side `NumberRange(max=...)` bound. The label-as-not-required (no asterisk) is intentional — `Optional()` + `default=0` allow blank/missing input.

- [ ] **Task 9: Surface `sort_order` in the admin areas list template.**
  - File: `esb/templates/admin/areas.html`
  - Action:
    - Desktop table (lines 14-36): add a `<th>Sort Order</th>` between `<th>Name</th>` and `<th>Slack Channel</th>`, and a corresponding `<td>{{ area.sort_order }}</td>` in the row body.
    - Mobile card section (lines 39-50): inside each card, after the slack-channel line, add `<p class="card-text text-muted mb-2 small">Sort order: {{ area.sort_order }}</p>`.
  - Notes: Areas in this template already arrive in `(sort_order, name)` order from `list_areas()` after Task 3 — no template-side sorting needed.

- [ ] **Task 10: Extend the `_create_area` fixture helper to accept `sort_order`.**
  - File: `tests/conftest.py:77-88`
  - Action: Change `_create_area(name='Test Area', slack_channel='#test-area')` to `_create_area(name='Test Area', slack_channel='#test-area', sort_order=0)`. Pass `sort_order=sort_order` to the `Area(...)` constructor. The `make_area` fixture at line 86 returns the bound helper unchanged.
  - Notes: Existing `make_area(...)` call sites (hundreds across the test suite) pass `name` and/or `slack_channel` only — the new optional keyword arg is additive and won't break any of them. New tests in Tasks 11-13 use `make_area(name=..., sort_order=N)` rather than constructing `Area(...)` manually, keeping a single fixture pattern.

- [ ] **Task 11: Update / extend tests for `equipment_service.list_areas()`.**
  - File: `tests/test_services/test_equipment_service.py` (around line 18-30)
  - Action:
    - In `test_returns_active_areas_ordered`, update both the test name and docstring (or just the docstring) to mention `(sort_order, name)` ordering. The existing assertion still passes because all areas have `sort_order=0` and the secondary key is `name`.
    - Add new test `test_orders_by_sort_order_then_name`: use `make_area(name='Area A', sort_order=10)`, `make_area(name='Area B', sort_order=5)`, `make_area(name='Area C', sort_order=5)`; assert `[a.name for a in list_areas()] == ['Area B', 'Area C', 'Area A']`.
  - Notes: Use the extended fixture from Task 10. Do not construct `Area(...)` manually.

- [ ] **Task 12: Add ordering tests for `get_area_status_dashboard()`.**
  - File: `tests/test_services/test_status_service.py` (in `TestGetAreaStatusDashboard`, around line 266)
  - Action:
    - Update the existing `test_multiple_areas_sorted_by_name` (line 266): change its docstring to mention `(sort_order, name)` ordering. The existing assertion still passes (all areas have default `sort_order=0`) but now documents the compound rule.
    - Add new test `test_orders_areas_by_sort_order_then_name`. Use `make_area(..., sort_order=N)` for three areas with mixed values; create one piece of equipment per area via `make_equipment` (the service returns areas regardless of equipment, but matching the existing fixture pattern keeps the test idiomatic); assert `[r['area'].name for r in status_service.get_area_status_dashboard()]` is in the expected order.
  - Notes: Verify the service does NOT depend on equipment presence by reading the code — if it does (e.g., `selectattr` filter inside the service), adapt the test accordingly. Today's code returns all non-archived areas regardless.

- [ ] **Task 13: Update service tests for `create_area`/`update_area` to cover `sort_order`.**
  - File: `tests/test_services/test_equipment_service.py` (TestCreateArea class starting line 138; TestUpdateArea starting around line 207)
  - Action:
    - `TestCreateArea`: add `test_creates_area_with_sort_order` that passes `sort_order=42` and asserts `area.sort_order == 42`; add `test_creates_area_with_default_sort_order` that omits the kwarg and asserts `area.sort_order == 0`; add `test_logs_sort_order_in_created_event` that uses `capture` to verify the `area.created` mutation payload includes `'sort_order': 42`.
    - `TestUpdateArea`: add `test_updates_sort_order` that mutates `sort_order` from 0 to 7 via `update_area(..., sort_order=7)` and verifies persistence and that the `log_mutation` `changes` payload contains `{'sort_order': [0, 7]}`. Add `test_no_log_when_sort_order_unchanged` (model on existing `test_no_log_when_no_changes` at line 271): set `area.sort_order = 5`, call `update_area(..., sort_order=5)`, assert no `area.updated` event is emitted (guarded by the existing `if changes:` block). Add `test_omitted_sort_order_kwarg_preserves_value`: create an area with `sort_order=5`, call the legacy `update_area(area_id, 'Same Name', '#same', 'staffuser')` (no `sort_order` kwarg), then assert `area.sort_order == 5`. This pins the keyword-only-sentinel contract — old positional calls must not clobber the field.
    - Verify all seven existing positional `update_area(area_id, name, slack_channel, updated_by)` call sites in this file still pass — they will, because Task 5 made `sort_order` keyword-only.
  - Notes: The `capture` fixture used elsewhere in the file (look around line 178 for prior usage) is the right tool for asserting on mutation events.

- [ ] **Task 14: Update view tests for admin area routes.**
  - File: `tests/test_views/test_admin_views.py`
  - Action:
    - **`TestCreateAreaPost` (line 606)**:
      - Add `test_creates_area_with_sort_order`: POSTs `{'name': 'X', 'slack_channel': '#x', 'sort_order': '7'}` and asserts the persisted area has `sort_order == 7`.
      - Add `test_creates_area_with_empty_sort_order_defaults_to_zero`: POSTs `sort_order=''` (explicit empty string from the rendered form) and asserts the area is created with `sort_order == 0` — this guards against the empty-string POST regression that the view-layer `None → 0` coercion (Task 7) prevents.
      - Add `test_creates_area_rejects_negative_sort_order` (covers AC 6): POSTs `sort_order='-3'`, asserts `resp.status_code == 200` (re-render, not redirect), `b'Sort order must be between 0 and 999999.' in resp.data`, AND that no area row was inserted (count via `_db.session.execute(_db.select(Area)).all()`).
      - Add `test_creates_area_rejects_over_max_sort_order` (covers AC 6): POSTs `sort_order='1000000'`, same assertions as above.
      - Add `test_creates_area_rejects_non_integer_sort_order` (covers AC 6): POSTs `sort_order='abc'`, same assertions as above; assert that the rendered HTML contains *both* `b'Not a valid integer value.'` and `b'Sort order must be between 0 and 999999.'` (WTForms emits both).
    - **`TestEditArea` (line 659)**:
      - Add `test_updates_sort_order`: POSTs an edit with a changed `sort_order` and asserts the updated value.
      - Extend `test_renders_edit_form` (line 662) to also assert `b'Sort Order'` is present in the form HTML AND that the rendered field has the area's current value. Use a regex anchored to the field's `name` attribute to avoid matching other inputs:
        ```python
        import re
        assert b'Sort Order' in resp.data
        match = re.search(rb'<input [^>]*name="sort_order"[^>]*>', resp.data)
        assert match is not None
        assert b'value="0"' in match.group(0)  # area created via make_area defaults to 0
        ```
    - **`TestListAreas` (line 530)** (covers AC 7):
      - Add `test_table_shows_sort_order_column`: GET `/admin/areas`, assert `b'Sort Order' in resp.data` (column header) and that the rendered HTML contains the area's `sort_order` value rendered as a table cell. Use a regex anchored on the area-row structure rather than a bare substring search.
      - Add `test_areas_listed_in_sort_order_then_name`: create three areas with mixed `sort_order` (e.g., `make_area(name='Area A', sort_order=10)`, `Area B sort_order=5`, `Area C sort_order=5`), GET `/admin/areas`, then assert the byte-positions of the names: `resp.data.find(b'Area B') < resp.data.find(b'Area C') < resp.data.find(b'Area A')`. Sentinel-check first that each `find()` returns a non-negative value.
    - **`TestAreaMutationLogging` (line 923)**:
      - Add `test_sort_order_change_logged`: edits only `sort_order` and asserts the logged `data.changes` dict contains a `sort_order` key whose value is `[old, new]`.
      - Add `test_no_log_when_sort_order_unchanged`: re-saves the same value and asserts no `area.updated` log entry is emitted (the existing `if changes:` guard at `equipment_service.py:129` enforces this). Cover both the `5 → 5` and `0 → 0` cases (the latter is the more common scenario for users who never touch the field).
    - **`TestArchiveArea` (line 717)**:
      - Add `test_archive_preserves_sort_order`: create an area with explicit `sort_order=5`, call the existing `archive_area` service via POST `/admin/areas/<id>/archive`, then assert the column value via direct DB query (`_db.session.get(Area, area.id).sort_order == 5`). Do not toggle `is_archived` back via the ORM — it is not a public-API operation and there is no UI for it; the assertion on the column value is sufficient to pin "archive does not touch sort_order."
  - Notes: No changes required to existing tests because the new form field has `Optional()` + `default=0`; absent form keys resolve to 0. All new tests use the extended `make_area(..., sort_order=N)` fixture from Task 10.

- [ ] **Task 14b: Add view-level ordering tests for public dashboard and kiosk (covers AC 2/3/4 at the rendered-HTML layer).**
  - File: `tests/test_views/test_public_views.py`
  - Action: Add two tests (mirror the pattern from `TestListAreas::test_areas_listed_in_sort_order_then_name`):
    - `test_status_dashboard_renders_areas_in_sort_order_then_name`: GET `/`, assert area-name byte positions in `resp.data` reflect `(sort_order, name)`. Each area needs at least one piece of equipment because the public dashboard renders area sections regardless, but kiosk filters empties.
    - `test_kiosk_renders_areas_in_sort_order_then_name`: GET `/kiosk`, same assertion pattern (with each area populated).
  - Notes: Sentinel-check `find()` results to be non-negative before the comparison chain (otherwise `-1 < N` silently passes for missing names). Pattern:
    ```python
    pos_b = resp.data.find(b'Area B')
    pos_c = resp.data.find(b'Area C')
    pos_a = resp.data.find(b'Area A')
    assert pos_b >= 0 and pos_c >= 0 and pos_a >= 0, 'one or more area names missing from response'
    assert pos_b < pos_c < pos_a
    ```

- [ ] **Task 15: Add ordering regression tests for dropdown surfaces.**
  - File: `tests/test_views/test_equipment_views.py` and `tests/test_views/test_repair_views.py` (or extend existing test files that cover these views)
  - Action: Add one test per page that creates three areas with mixed `sort_order`, renders the page, and asserts area-name order in the rendered HTML:
    - Equipment registry filter dropdown at `/equipment` (rendered from `equipment_service.list_areas()` via `esb/views/equipment.py:43`).
    - Equipment create form area dropdown at `/equipment/new` (esb/views/equipment.py:80-82). Note: the choices list prepends `(0, '-- Select Area --')` as the first `<option>` — strip it before asserting on order.
    - Equipment edit form area dropdown at `/equipment/<id>/edit` (esb/views/equipment.py:167-170). Same `-- Select Area --` placeholder.
    - Repair queue area filter at `/repairs/queue` (esb/views/repairs.py:115). Note: that template prepends an `<option value="">All Areas</option>` placeholder — strip before asserting.
  - Notes: Use a minimal extraction pattern that strips placeholder rows. Example:
    ```python
    import re
    options = re.findall(r'<option[^>]*>([^<]+)</option>', resp.data.decode())
    area_options = [o for o in options if o not in ('-- Select Area --', 'All Areas')]
    assert area_options == ['Area B', 'Area C', 'Area A']
    ```
    Repeat per page. Do not import BeautifulSoup; the regex above is sufficient and the project does not depend on it.

- [ ] **Task 16: Add Slack `format_status_summary` ordering test.**
  - File: `tests/test_slack/test_forms.py` (after the existing tests around line 514)
  - Action: Add `test_format_status_summary_respects_area_sort_order`. Create three areas with mixed `sort_order` plus one piece of equipment in each; call `format_status_summary(status_service.get_area_status_dashboard())`; assert area-header line order. Use string-position assertions rather than naive line splitting because the function interleaves area-count lines with non-green equipment bullet lines:
    ```python
    summary = format_status_summary(status_service.get_area_status_dashboard())
    pos_b = summary.find('Area B')
    pos_c = summary.find('Area C')
    pos_a = summary.find('Area A')
    assert pos_b >= 0 and pos_c >= 0 and pos_a >= 0, 'area names missing from summary'
    assert pos_b < pos_c < pos_a
    ```
    Do not split on `\n` — equipment bullets containing area-name substrings would match incorrectly. Sentinel-check `find()` results to defend against silent passes when a name is missing (`-1 < N` is always True).
  - Notes: For `format_status_summary` itself, no production code change is needed (it consumes whatever order `get_area_status_dashboard()` returns). The dispatcher modal IS a code change (see Task 4b).

- [ ] **Task 17: Add static page export ordering integration test.**
  - File: `tests/test_services/test_static_page_service.py` (file exists; extend the existing `TestGenerate` class)
  - Action: Add `test_generate_orders_areas_by_sort_order_then_name` to the `TestGenerate` class. Create three areas with mixed `sort_order` (e.g., `make_area(name='Area A', sort_order=10)`, `make_area(name='Area B', sort_order=5)`, `make_area(name='Area C', sort_order=5)`) plus one piece of equipment in each; invoke `static_page_service.generate()`; sentinel-check that each area name appears in the HTML before asserting positions:
    ```python
    pos_b = html.find('Area B')
    pos_c = html.find('Area C')
    pos_a = html.find('Area A')
    assert pos_b >= 0 and pos_c >= 0 and pos_a >= 0, 'area names missing from rendered HTML'
    assert pos_b < pos_c < pos_a
    ```
    Without the sentinel, `find()` returning `-1` for a missing name silently passes the comparison.
  - Notes: The file already imports `app`, `make_area`, `make_equipment` fixtures via the project conftest. Use the same `make_area` / `make_equipment` pattern as the existing `test_returns_html_with_area_and_equipment` test. Do NOT create a new test module.

- [ ] **Task 18: Bump `pyproject.toml` version to `0.7.0` (per CLAUDE.md "Releases").**
  - File: `pyproject.toml` (line 3: `version = "0.6.0"`)
  - Action: Change `version = "0.6.0"` to `version = "0.7.0"`. The current value matches the latest git tag (`v0.6.0`), so any value not strictly greater would cause the release workflow to no-op silently. Minor bump is appropriate because this is a new user-visible feature.
  - Notes: Per CLAUDE.md, the release workflow auto-tags and publishes the Docker image when the version on `main` is strictly greater than the latest tag. Do not maintain a CHANGELOG — release notes are auto-generated from PR titles.

- [ ] **Task 19: Run the full test suite and lint.**
  - File: (commands)
  - Action: Run `make test` and `make lint`. Address any failures before considering the task done.
  - Notes: Per CLAUDE.md, ruff is configured at 120 chars / target py3.13.

- [ ] **Task 20: Verify the migration manually against MariaDB (covers AC 1).**
  - File: (commands; no source change)
  - Action: AC 1 — that the migration backfills existing rows to `sort_order=0` — has no automated test (the test fixture uses `db.create_all()` from models, not Alembic). Verify manually:
    1. Ensure the DB container is running (`docker compose up -d db`) and contains pre-existing area rows. If the DB is empty, insert two rows with the OLD schema (i.e., before applying this migration) — for example, by checking out `main`, running `make migrate`, then creating areas via `/admin/areas/new`.
    2. Switch to the issue branch and apply the new migration: `DATABASE_URL=mysql+pymysql://root:esb_dev_password@<container_ip>/esb flask db upgrade`.
    3. Connect to the DB (`docker exec -it equipment-status-board-db-1 mariadb -uroot -pesb_dev_password esb`) and run `SELECT id, name, sort_order FROM areas;`. All pre-existing rows MUST show `sort_order=0`.
    4. Run `flask db downgrade` then `flask db upgrade` again to confirm the cycle works structurally (with the documented caveat that user-set values are lost on downgrade).
  - Notes: Cannot be automated in CI without a MariaDB-backed test job. Document the verification result in the PR description.

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] **AC 1 — Migration applies cleanly with backfill:**
  Given the database contains existing area rows from before this change, when `flask db upgrade` runs the new migration, then the `sort_order` column exists, is NOT NULL, and every pre-existing row has `sort_order = 0`.

- [ ] **AC 2 — Default behavior matches today's alphabetical order:**
  Given two or more areas with `sort_order = 0` (the default), when the status dashboard, kiosk, static export, or admin areas page is rendered, then areas appear in alphabetical order by `name`.

- [ ] **AC 3 — Explicit sort_order takes precedence over name:**
  Given areas `Zebra` (`sort_order=1`) and `Alpha` (`sort_order=2`), when any multi-area view is rendered, then `Zebra` appears before `Alpha`.

- [ ] **AC 4 — Ties resolve alphabetically:**
  Given areas `Charlie`, `Alpha`, `Bravo` all with `sort_order = 5`, when any multi-area view is rendered, then the order is `Alpha`, `Bravo`, `Charlie`.

- [ ] **AC 5 — Admin form accepts and persists sort_order:**
  Given a staff user on `/admin/areas/new` or `/admin/areas/<id>/edit`, when they submit the form with `sort_order = 7`, then the area is created/updated with `sort_order == 7` and the user is redirected back to `/admin/areas` with the success flash.

- [ ] **AC 6 — Admin form validates `sort_order` bounds (server-side authoritative):**
  Given a staff user submits the create or edit form with `sort_order = -3`, when the form is processed, then the form re-renders with a validation error on the `sort_order` field and no DB change occurs. Given the same form with `sort_order = 1000000` (above the `max=999999` bound), the same validation rejection occurs. Given a non-integer like `sort_order = 'abc'`, validation fails with both `Not a valid integer value.` and `Number must be between 0 and 999999.` errors. These ACs are verified using `client.post` (the test client bypasses HTML5 input attributes), confirming the server-side `NumberRange` and `IntegerField` validators are authoritative regardless of client behavior.

- [ ] **AC 7 — Admin areas list shows the value:**
  Given multiple areas exist with distinct `sort_order` values, when a staff user loads `/admin/areas`, then the rendered HTML contains each area's `sort_order` value (desktop table column and mobile card line both pass), and the areas appear in `(sort_order, name)` order.

- [ ] **AC 8 — Mutation event records the change when sort_order actually changes:**
  Given an area with `sort_order = 0`, when a staff user edits it to `sort_order = 4`, then exactly one JSON-formatted log entry with `event = 'area.updated'` is emitted and its `data.changes` dict contains `sort_order: [0, 4]`. Given a staff user submits the edit form with the **same** `sort_order` value (no change), then NO `area.updated` log entry is emitted — the `if changes:` guard in `update_area` suppresses the event.

- [ ] **AC 9 — Static page export reflects the new order:**
  Given areas with explicit `sort_order` values, when `static_page_service.generate()` is invoked, then the resulting HTML lists area sections in `(sort_order, name)` order.

- [ ] **AC 10 — Empty-string and absent `sort_order` POST both resolve to default:**
  Given a staff user submits the create form with `sort_order=''` (the browser's representation of a cleared field), when the form is processed, then the area is created with `sort_order = 0` (via `Optional()` + `default=0`). The same holds for POSTs that omit the `sort_order` key entirely — the suite's pre-existing test POSTs to `/admin/areas/new` and `/admin/areas/<id>/edit` continue to pass with no payload changes.

- [ ] **AC 11 — `area.created` audit log includes `sort_order`:**
  Given a staff user creates an area with `sort_order = 9`, when the `area.created` mutation event is emitted, then its `data` payload contains `sort_order: 9` alongside the existing `id`, `name`, and `slack_channel` fields.

- [ ] **AC 12 — Slack `/esb-status` reflects the new ordering:**
  Given areas with explicit `sort_order` values and equipment in each, when `esb/slack/forms.py:format_status_summary` is invoked with the result of `get_area_status_dashboard()`, then the per-area lines in the returned summary text appear in `(sort_order, name)` order.

- [ ] **AC 12b — Slack `/esb-repair` dispatcher modal area groups respect the new ordering:**
  Given multiple areas with mixed `sort_order` values and at least one open repair record per area, when `build_repair_dispatcher_modal(open_records)` is invoked, then the modal's `option_groups` array is ordered by `(sort_order, name)` rather than alphabetical-by-name. (The `'No Area'` sentinel bucket in the function body is unreachable in production because `equipment.area_id` is `NOT NULL` per `esb/models/equipment.py`; the defensive code remains for safety but is not part of any AC.)

- [ ] **AC 13 — Equipment and repair-form dropdowns reflect the new ordering:**
  Given areas with explicit `sort_order` values, when a staff user loads `/equipment`, `/equipment/new`, `/equipment/<id>/edit`, or `/repairs/queue`, then the `<option>` elements in each area dropdown appear in `(sort_order, name)` order.

- [ ] **AC 14 — `sort_order` is preserved through archive/unarchive cycles:**
  Given an area with `sort_order = 5`, when a staff user archives the area via POST `/admin/areas/<id>/archive`, then the `sort_order` column value in the DB is still 5. (Unarchiving is not currently exposed via a UI, but if the row is later set to `is_archived=False`, the original sort_order is intact.)

## Additional Context

### Dependencies

- No new Python packages required. `IntegerField` and `NumberRange` are already part of WTForms (already a transitive dependency via Flask-WTF).
- Docker DB container must be running locally to generate the Alembic migration (see CLAUDE.md "Database Migrations").
- Depends on the existing service-layer pattern; no upstream blockers.

### Testing Strategy

- **Unit tests (services):**
  - Ordering: explicit assertions on `list_areas()` and `get_area_status_dashboard()` ordering with mixed `sort_order` values (Tasks 11, 12).
  - Mutations: `create_area` and `update_area` persist `sort_order`; `update_area` emits `log_mutation` with `changes['sort_order'] = [old, new]` only when the value actually changes; no event on unchanged value (Task 13).
  - Defensive int coercion: `create_area(sort_order='7')` is accepted and `area.sort_order == 7` (covered by the new tests).
- **View tests (admin):**
  - POST flows for create/edit with `sort_order` set (`'7'`), empty (`''`), and omitted (Task 14).
  - Validation rejection of negative values, values above `max=999999`, and non-integer input (`'abc'`) — covers AC 6 (Task 14).
  - Admin areas list (`/admin/areas`) shows the `Sort Order` column header and renders areas in `(sort_order, name)` order — covers AC 7 (Task 14, `TestListAreas`).
  - Mutation logging round-trip including both no-op cases (`5→5` and `0→0`).
  - Form re-render shows current value via `obj=area` on edit (with regex anchored to the `name="sort_order"` attribute).
  - Archive preserves `sort_order` (`TestArchiveArea::test_archive_preserves_sort_order`).
  - Existing tests must remain green without payload changes (AC 10).
- **View tests (public dashboard / kiosk):** New ordering regression tests at the rendered-HTML layer for `/` (status dashboard) and `/kiosk` — covers AC 2/3/4 at the view layer (Task 14b).
- **View tests (dropdowns):** New regression tests for area dropdown order on `/equipment`, `/equipment/new`, `/equipment/<id>/edit`, and `/repairs/queue` (Task 15).
- **Slack tests:** New ordering test for `format_status_summary` (Task 16) in `tests/test_slack/test_forms.py`.
- **Static page tests:** New ordering integration test for `static_page_service.generate()` (Task 17) in `tests/test_services/test_static_page_service.py`.
- **Integration / manual verification:**
  - Start dev server (`make run`), log in as staff, create three areas with explicit sort orders (e.g., 10, 5, 5 with names B, A, C), confirm the public status dashboard (`/`), kiosk view, and `/admin/areas` all reflect `(5,A), (5,C), (10,B)` order.
  - Trigger a static page export and confirm the same ordering in the generated HTML.
  - Run `/esb-status` in Slack (if configured) and confirm the per-area lines respect the same ordering.
- **Migration verification:** Run `flask db upgrade` against a populated DB and confirm all pre-existing area rows have `sort_order = 0`; run `flask db downgrade` then `flask db upgrade` to confirm structural cycle (with the caveat that user-set values are lost on downgrade).

### Notes

- **Partial-POST behavior with `obj=area`.** The `edit_area` view constructs the form as `AreaEditForm(obj=area)`. WTForms preserves the obj's value if formdata does not contain the form key — meaning a POST that omits `sort_order` entirely keeps the current DB value (because `data == 0` from the absent-key/default path is then overlaid by the obj). However, real browser submissions of the rendered HTML always include the form key. The expected per-submission behavior is therefore:
  - User loads `/admin/areas/<id>/edit`: form renders with `value="<current sort_order>"`.
  - User clicks Save without changing the field: browser POSTs `sort_order=<current value>` → service sees the same int → no `area.updated` event (guarded by `if changes:`).
  - User clears the field and clicks Save: browser POSTs `sort_order=''` → `Optional()` skips `NumberRange` → `data is None` → view coerces to `0` → service updates `sort_order` to 0 (and emits `area.updated` if the prior value was non-zero).
  - User submits a non-integer like `abc`: validation fails (both `Not a valid integer value.` and `Number must be between 0 and 999999.` errors), form re-renders with all other field values preserved by WTForms.
- **Risk: forgotten migration apply.** If a developer runs the test suite (SQLite in-memory rebuilds the schema from models each time) but never applies the migration to MariaDB, the prod schema will lag the code. Mitigation: this is the standard repo workflow — the release workflow runs `flask db upgrade` on container startup.
- **Test DB does NOT exercise the migration.** The test fixture in `tests/conftest.py` calls `_db.create_all()` which builds tables from the SQLAlchemy model metadata, not from migrations. As a consequence, the migration's `server_default='0'` is never executed against SQLite during tests — the test DB relies on the ORM-level `default=0`. This means a working test suite does NOT prove the migration backfills correctly; AC 1 must be verified manually against MariaDB (per the Migration Verification step in Testing Strategy).
- **`server_default='0'` vs SQLite.** SQLite stores the DDL-level default as a string literal `'0'` for INTEGER columns, which works correctly with SQLAlchemy's `Integer` type. No special handling needed — but be aware that the DDL emitted for the test DB and prod DB differ slightly.
- **`op.batch_alter_table` is not strictly required for `add_column` on MariaDB** — it is primarily needed for SQLite ALTER limitations. The existing migration uses batch mode for its `create_index` step. We retain batch mode here for consistency with the project's pattern, but plain `op.add_column` would work too.
- **MariaDB vs SQLite collation differs on `name` secondary sort.** MariaDB's default `utf8mb4_general_ci` collation is case-insensitive, while SQLite's BINARY collation is case-sensitive (uppercase letters sort before lowercase). For mixed-case area names like `apple` and `Banana`, SQLite (tests) returns `Banana, apple` while MariaDB (prod) returns `apple, Banana`. Test fixtures use proper-case names exclusively, so this divergence won't surface in CI; flag if a real area is named in mixed case and the order looks "wrong" on the dashboard.
- **UX: cleared field re-renders blank.** If a user clears the sort_order field and submits, the value resets to 0 (per the Partial-POST behavior above), but the form re-render after a *failed* save (e.g., name conflict) will show the field as empty rather than `0`. The form-text "Leave at 0 for default" still applies but is slightly misleading after a clear-and-fail. Acceptable for an admin-only field; document if user feedback comes in.
- **Audit log contract change.** After this PR, every `area.created` event payload contains a `sort_order` key (always present, often `0`). Downstream log consumers — Loki dashboards, Splunk queries, custom log scrapers — should be updated if they enforce a strict schema. The repo currently does not have such consumers; this is informational.
- **Sort_order gaps from archives.** Archived areas keep their `sort_order` (Technical Decisions). If staff archives an area at sort_order=20 and reorders neighbors, the visible sequence may show numeric gaps (0, 5, 10, 50). This is a minor UX implication, not a bug; staff can renumber.
- **Risk: downgrade destroys user-set sort values.** `flask db downgrade` runs `batch_op.drop_column('sort_order')`, which is not a value-preserving reversal. If a downgrade is run in error and then re-upgraded, all rows reset to `0`. This is acceptable for emergency rollback only.
- **Release process** (per CLAUDE.md "Releases"): bump `pyproject.toml` `version` field as part of this work — see Task 18. The release workflow auto-tags and publishes the Docker image when the version on `main` exceeds the latest tag. No manual tagging or `CHANGELOG.md` maintenance is needed.
- **Known limitation:** No bulk-reorder UI. Staff will set values one at a time. Acceptable for the current handful of areas at Decatur Makers.
- **Future considerations (explicitly out of scope):**
  - Drag-and-drop reorder UI on `/admin/areas`.
  - Optional secondary sort for equipment within an area.
  - A composite `(sort_order, name)` index on the `areas` table if the table ever grows beyond a few dozen rows (today's filesort is fine at this scale).
